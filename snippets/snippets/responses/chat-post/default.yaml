    Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts
    of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They use deep
    learning architectures, particularly transformers, to process and produce
    language.


    Key characteristics of LLMs include:


    1. **Scale**: They're trained on billions or trillions of parameters, making
    them capable of understanding complex patterns in language.


    2. **Versatility**: LLMs can perform various tasks like translation,
    summarization, question answering, and creative writing without being
    explicitly programmed for each task.


    3. **Context Understanding**: They can maintain context over long
    conversations and generate coherent, contextually relevant responses.


    4. **Few-shot Learning**: LLMs can often perform new tasks with just a few
    examples, adapting to new scenarios quickly.


    Popular examples include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models,
    BERT, and Cohere's Command models. These models have revolutionized natural
    language processing and enabled new applications across industries.
