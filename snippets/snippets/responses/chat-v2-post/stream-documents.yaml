The latter is the only one we haven't study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.\n\nIt wasn't a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold."
