          Both NSync and Backstreet Boys were extremely popular at the turn of the
          millennium. Backstreet Boys had massive album sales across the globe,
          great singles sales, plenty of chart-topping releases, hyped tours, and
          tremendous media coverage. NSync also had huge sales, with their album No
          Strings Attached selling 2.4 million units in its first week. They also
          had the second fastest-selling album of the Soundscan era before 2015,
          with Celebrity debuting at 1.88 million units sold.


          While it is difficult to say for sure which of the two bands was more popular, Backstreet Boys did have success in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.

                CSPC: NSYNC Popularity Analysis


                MJD Posted on February 9, 2018 Posted in CSPC 27 Comments Tagged with Boy band, N'Sync


                At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in the US, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The latter is the only one we haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week alone.


                It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88 million units sold.

                At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive albums sales across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart topping releases, hugely hyped tours and tremendous media coverage.


                It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good market conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time record year for the music business, as far as revenues in billion dollars are concerned, was actually 1999. That is, back when this five men group was at its peak.

                1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of the very best years.

                Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and young women’s – embraced their output deserves its own chapter. If Jonas Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western artists.


                We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article with final results which will more than surprise many readers.
