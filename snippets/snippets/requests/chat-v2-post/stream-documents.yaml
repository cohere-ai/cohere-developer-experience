        Music industry – One step closer to being accurate

        At one point, Backstreet Boys defined success: massive albums sales
        across the globe, great singles sales, plenty of chart topping releases,
        hugely hyped tours and tremendous media coverage.


        It is true that they benefited from extraordinarily good market
        conditions in all markets. After all, the all-time record year for the
        music business, as far as revenues in billion dollars are concerned, was
        actually 1999. That is, back when this five men group was at its peak.

        CSPC: NSYNC Popularity Analysis

        At the turn of the millennium three teen acts were huge in the US, the
        Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. The latter is the only one we
        haven’t study so far. It took 15 years and Adele to break their record
        of 2,4 million units sold of No Strings Attached in its first week
        alone.


        It wasn’t a fluke, as the second fastest selling album of the Soundscan
        era prior 2015, was also theirs since Celebrity debuted with 1,88
        million units sold.

        1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 also rank amongst some of the very best years.

        Yet the way many music consumers – especially teenagers and young
        women’s – embraced their output deserves its own chapter. If Jonas
        Brothers and more recently One Direction reached a great level of
        popularity during the past decade, the type of success achieved by
        Backstreet Boys is in a completely different level as they really
        dominated the business for a few years all over the world, including in
        some countries that were traditionally hard to penetrate for Western
        artists.


        We will try to analyze the extent of that hegemony with this new article
        with final results which will more than surprise many readers.

        Was the teen group led by Justin Timberlake really that big? Was it only
        in the US where they found success? Or were they a global phenomenon?

        As usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept in
        order to relevantly gauge their results. This concept will not only
        bring you sales information for all NSYNC‘s albums, physical and
        download singles, as well as audio and video streaming, but it will also
        determine their true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the
        CSPC method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully
        recommend watching the video before getting into the sales figures.
