novel relevance endpoint that takes a query and a list of documents and predicts the relevance between the query and each document. \n\nIt can be used in a two-stage retrieval setup: First you take the user question, and retrieve the top-100 documents from your collection by either using lexical search or semantic search.\n\nYou then pass the question and these top-100 documents to our relevance-endpoint to get a score for each document. You can then rank these documents based on these scores.\n\nIn our benchmarks across 20 datasets, we **saw significant improvements compared to lexical and semantic search**, especially for use-cases where no training data is available.\n\nWe will demonstrate the rerank endpoint in this notebook.\n\n\n\n\n```python\n!pip install \"cohere<5\"\n```\n\n    \u001b[33mDEPRECATION: Configuring installation scheme with distutils config files is deprecated and will no longer work in the near future.

At the same time, the Chinese calendar is still used for traditional Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year.\n    \t18.151\tBefore that, the holiday was usually just called the \"NewYear\". Because the traditional Chinese calendar is mostly based on the changes in the moon, the Chinese New Year is also known in English as the \"Lunar New Year\" or \"Chinese Lunar New Year\". This name comes from \"Luna\", an old Latin name for the moon. The Indonesian name for the holiday is Imlek, which comes from the Hokkien word for the old Chinese calendar and is therefore also like saying \"Lunar New Year\".\n    \t18.011\tSpring Festival is the Chinese New Year.\n    \n    Top-3 hits by rank-API (100 BM25 hits re-ranked)\n    \t0.999\tChinese New Year, known in China as the SpringFestival and in Singapore as the LunarNewYear, is a holiday on and around the new moon on the first day of the year in the traditional Chinese calendar. This calendar is based on the changes in the moon and is only sometimes changed to fit the seasons of the year based on how the Earth moves around the sun. Because of this, Chinese New Year is never on January1. It moves around between January21 and February20.\n    \t0.997\tChinese New Year always starts on a new moon, when the Moon is between the Earth and Sun and it looks all dark in the night sky. Because new moons happen about every 29.53 days but the year set by Pope GregoryXIII is 365.2425 days long, the Chinese holiday moves to different days each year. The Chinese calendar adds a 13th month every so often to keep the seasons in the right place, so the first day of the new year always happens between January21 and February20 on the 2nd or 3rd new moon after the 1st day of winter. The chart on the right gives the day of each Chinese New Year from 1996 to 2031.\n    \t0.996\tChinese New Year lasts fifteen days, including one week as a national holiday. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. It is always in the middle of winter, but is called the Spring Festival in Chinese because Chinese seasons are a little different from English ones. On the first day of the Chinese New Year, people call on friends and relatives. Because most people watch the special performances on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Chinese New Year is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:财神爷), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:饺子. Pinyin: Jaozi). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck. The last day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:汤圆,元宵), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.\n\n\n\n```python\nsearch(query=\"How many people live in Paris\")\n```\n\n    Input question: How many people live in Paris\n    Top-3 lexical search (BM25) hits\n    \t16.277\tLive à Paris (English: \"Live in Paris\") is a live album by Canadian singer Céline Dion.\n    \t15.173\tÎle-de-France is a region of France.
