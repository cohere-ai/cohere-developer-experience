[Get started](#start)\n2. [Construct the evaluation dataset](#dataset)\n3. [Build the evaluation framework](#eval-framework)\n5. [Run evaluations](#run-evals)\n\n<a id=\"start\"></a>\n<a name=\"start\"></a>\n## Get Started\n\nYou'll need a Cohere API key to run this notebook. If you don't have a key, head to https://cohere.com/ to generate your key.\n\n\n```python\n!pip install cohere datasets --quiet\n```\n\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport random\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\nimport cohere\nfrom getpass import getpass\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nimport pandas as pd\n\nco_api_key = getpass(\"Enter your Cohere API key: \")\nco_model = \"command-r\"\nco = cohere.Client(api_key=co_api_key)\n```\n\nAs test data, we'll use transcripts from the [QMSum dataset](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/QMSum). Note that in addition to the transcripts, this dataset also contains reference summaries -- we will use only the transcripts as our approach is reference-free.\n\n\n```python\nqmsum = load_dataset(\"MocktaiLEngineer/qmsum-processed\", split=\"validation\")\ntranscripts = [x for x in qmsum[\"meeting_transcript\"] if x is not None]\n```\n\n\n    Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/1095 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]\n\n\n\n    Generating validation split:   0%|          | 0/237 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]\n\n\n\n    Generating test split:   0%|          | 0/244 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]\n\n\n<a id=\"dataset\"></a>\n<a name=\"dataset\"></a>\n## Construct the evaluation dataset\n\nWe are interested in evaluating summarization in real-world, enterprise use cases, which typically have two distinguishing features as compared to academic summarization benchmarks:\n- Enterprise use cases often focus on specific summarization objectives, e.g. \"summarize action items\".\n- Enterprise use cases often feature specific instruction constraints, e.g. \"summarize in bullets with each bullet under 20 words\".\n\nTherefore, we must first create a dataset that contains diverse summarization prompts. We will do this programmatically by building prompts from their components, as defined below:\n- Prompt = text (e.g. transcript to be summarized) + instruction\n- Instruction = instruction objective (e.g. \"summarize action items\") + modifiers\n- Modifiers = format/length modifiers (e.g. \"use bullets\") + style/tone modifiers (e.g. \"do not mention names\") + ...\n\nFirst, we define the prompt that combines the text and instructions. Here, we use a very basic prompt:\n\n\n```python\nprompt_template = \"\"\"## meeting transcript\n{transcript}\n\n## instructions\n{instructions}\"\"\"\n```\n\nNext, we build the instructions. Because each instruction may have a different objective and modifiers, we track them using metadata. This will later be required for evaluation (i.e. to know what the prompt is asking).\n\n\n```python\n\ninstruction_objectives = {\n    \"general_summarization\": \"Summarize the meeting based on the transcript.\",\n    \"action_items\": \"What are the follow-up items based on the meeting transcript?\",\n}\n\nformat_length_modifiers = {\n    \"paragraphs_short\": {\n        \"text\": \"In paragraph form, output your response. Use at least 10 words and at most 50 words in total.\",\n        \"objectives\": [\"general_summarization\"],\n        \"eval_metadata\": {\n            \"format\": \"paragraphs\",\n            \"min_length\": 10,\n            \"max_length\": 50,\n        },\n    },\n    \"paragraphs_medium\": {\n        \"text\": \"Return the answer in the form of paragraphs. Make sure your answer is between 50 and 200 words long.\",\n        \"objectives\": [\"general_summarization\"],\n        \"eval_metadata\": {\n            \"format\": \"paragraphs\",\n            \"min_length\": 50,\n            \"max_length\": 200,\n        },\n    },\n    \"bullets_short_3\": {\n        \"text\": \"Format your answer in the form of bullets. Use exactly 3 bullets. Each bullet should be at least 10 words and at most 20 words.\",\n        \"objectives\": [\"general_summarization\", \"action_items\"],\n        \"eval_metadata\": {\n            \"format\": \"bullets\",\n            \"number\": 3,\n            \"min_length\": 10,\n            \"max_length\": 20,\n        },\n    },\n    \"bullets_medium_2\": {\n        \"text\": \"In bullets, output your response. Make sure to use exactly 2 bullets. Make sure each bullet is between 20 and 80 words long.\",\n        \"objectives\": [\"general_summarization\", \"action_items\"],\n        \"eval_metadata\": {\n            \"format\": \"bullets\",\n            \"number\": 2,\n            \"min_length\": 20,\n            \"max_length\": 80,\n        },\n    },\n}\n```\n\nLet's combine the objectives and format/length modifiers to finish building the instructions.\n\n\n```python\ninstructions = []\nfor obj_name, obj_text in instruction_objectives.items():\n    for mod_data in format_length_modifiers.values():\n        for mod_obj in mod_data[\"objectives\"]:\n            if mod_obj == obj_name:\n                instruction = {\n                        \"instruction\": f\"{obj_text} {mod_data['text']}\",\n                        \"eval_metadata\": mod_data[\"eval_metadata\"],\n                        \"objective\": obj_name,\n                    }\n                instructions.append(instruction)\n\nprint(json.dumps(instructions[:2], indent=4))\n```\n\n    [\n        {\n            \"instruction\": \"Summarize the meeting based on the transcript. In paragraph form, output your response. Use at least 10 words and at most 50 words in total.\",\n            \"eval_metadata\": {\n                \"format\": \"paragraphs\",\n                \"min_length\": 10,\n                \"max_length\": 50\n            },\n            \"objective\": \"general_summarization\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"instruction\": \"Summarize the meeting based on the transcript.

Make sure your answer is between 50 and 200 words long.\",\n            \"eval_metadata\": {\n                \"format\": \"paragraphs\",\n                \"min_length\": 50,\n                \"max_length\": 200\n            },\n            \"objective\": \"general_summarization\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n\nFinally, let's build the final prompts by semi-randomly pairing the instructions with transcripts from the QMSum dataset.\n\n\n```python\ndata = pd.DataFrame(instructions)\n\ntranscripts = sorted(transcripts, key=lambda x: len(x), reverse=True)[:int(len(transcripts) * 0.25)]\nrandom.seed(42)\nrandom.shuffle(transcripts)\ndata[\"transcript\"] = transcripts[:len(data)]\n\ndata[\"prompt\"] = data.apply(lambda x: prompt_template.format(transcript=x[\"transcript\"], instructions=x[\"instruction\"]), axis=1)\n```\n\n\n```python\ndata[\"transcript_token_len\"] = [len(x) for x in co.batch_tokenize(data[\"transcript\"].tolist(), model=co_model)]\n```\n\n\n```python\nprint(data[\"prompt\"][0])\n```\n\n    ## meeting transcript\n    PhD F: As opposed to the rest of us \n    PhD D: Well comment OK I I remind that me my first objective eh in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded But eh tsk comment ehhh comment In that way comment I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh eh one thousand acoustic events eh besides the overlapping zones eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh eh talk eh eh clap eh comment I do not know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the pause n speech \n    Grad G: Oh I do not think we ve been doing it at that level of detail So \n    PhD D: Eh I I I do I do not need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh I I will find eh eh a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh eh acoustic events to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh the false eh hypothesis eh nnn which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh eh difference eh feature \n    PhD A: You know I think some of these that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there s two there I mean if it s a tapping sound you would not necessarily or you know something like that it would be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events \n    Grad G: Well You were not talking about just overlaps were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events \n    PhD D: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone Eh ? comment n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh eh one thousand acoustic events \n    Professor E: How many overlaps were there in it ? No no how many of them were the overlaps of speech though ? \n    PhD D: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five eh in forty five minutes Alm Three hundred overlapping zone With the overlapping zone overlapping speech speech what eh different duration \n    Postdoc B: Does this ? So if you had an overlap involving three people how many times was that counted ? \n    PhD D: three people two people Eh I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background be \n    Professor E: No no but I think what she s asking is pause if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking instead of two did you call that one event ? \n    PhD D: Oh Oh I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event the overlapping zone the period where three speaker or eh are talking together \n    Grad G: So let s say me and Jane are talking at the same time and then Liz starts talking also over all of us How many events would that be ? \n    PhD D: So I do not understand \n    Grad G: So two people are talking comment and then a third person starts talking Is there an event right here ? \n    PhD D: Eh no No no For me is the overlapping zone because because you you have s you have more one eh more one voice eh eh produced in a in in a moment \n    Grad G: So i if two or more people are talking \n    Professor E: OK So I think We just wanted to understand how you are defining it So then in the region between since there there is some continuous region in between regions where there is only one person speaking And one contiguous region like that you are calling an event Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? \n    PhD D: I consider the the nnn the nnn nnn eh the entirety eh eh all all the time there were the voice has overlapped This is the idea But eh I I do not distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker I m not considering eh the the ehm eh the fact of eh eh for example what did you say ?

Use at least 10 words and at most 50 words in total.\n\n\n<a id=\"eval-framework\"></a>\n<a name=\"eval-framework\"></a>\n## Build the evaluation framework\n\nWe now setup the tools we will use for evaluation.\n\nWe use three criteria that are graded using LLMs:\n- Completeness: checks if the summary includes all the important information from the original text that it should include\n- Correctness: checks if there are any hallucinations or factual inaccuracies in the summary\n- Conciseness: checks if the summary includes any unnecessary information or wordiness\n\nIn this cookbook, we will use Command-R to grade the completions. However, note that in practice, we typically use an ensemble of multiple LLM evaluators to reduce any bias.\n\n\n```python\n\ngrading_prompt_template = \"\"\"You are an AI grader that given a prompt, a completion, and a criterion, grades the completion based on the prompt and criterion.
