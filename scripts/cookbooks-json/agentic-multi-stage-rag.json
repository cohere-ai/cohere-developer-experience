go-to use case that enterprises have been adopting with large language models (LLMs). Even though it works well in general, there are edge cases where this can fail. Most commonly, when the retrieved document mentions the query but actually refers to another document, the model will fail to generate the correct answer. \n\nWe propose an agentic RAG system that leverages tool use to continue to retrieve documents if correct ones were not retrieved at first try. This is ideal for use cases where accuracy is a top priority and latency is not. For example, lawyers trying to find the most accurate answer from their contracts are willing to wait a few more seconds to get the answer instead of getting wrong answers fast. \n\n\n## Objective\n\nThis notebook, we will explore how we can build a simple agentic RAG using Cohere's native API. We have prepared a fake dataset to demonstrate the use case. \nWe ask three questions that require different depths of retrieval. We will see how the model answers the question between simple and agentic RAG. \n\n\n## Disclaimer \n\nOne of the challenges in building a RAG system is that it has many moving pieces: vector database, type of embedding model, use of reranker, number of retrieved documents, chunking strategy, and more. These components can make debugging and evaluating RAG systems difficult. Since this notebook focuses on the concept of agentic RAG, it will simplify other parts of the RAG system. For example, we will only retrieve top 1 docuemnt to demonstrate what happens when retrieved document does not contain the answer needed. \n\n\n## Result \n\n|Type | Question | Simple Rag | Agentic Rag |  \n|---|--------------|---------|---------|\n|Single-stage retrieval|   Is there a state level law for wearing helmets?  | There is currently no state law requiring the use of helmets when riding a bicycle. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use. | There is currently no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles. | \n|Multi-stage retrieval|I live in orting, do I need to wear a helmet with a bike?|In the state of Washington, there is no law requiring you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use, so it is worth checking your local laws.|Yes, you do need to wear a helmet with a bike in Orting if you are under 17.|\n\nAs you will see more below, the multi-stage retrieval is achieved by adding a new function `reference_extractor()` that extracts other references in the documents and updating the instruction so the agent continues to retrieve more documents.  \n\n\n\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\nimport cohere\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n```\n\n\n```python\n# versions\nprint('cohere version:', cohere.__version__)\n```\n\n    cohere version: 5.5.1\n\n\n## Setup \n\n\n```python\nCOHERE_API_KEY = os.environ.get(\"CO_API_KEY\")\nCOHERE_MODEL = 'command-r-plus'\nco = cohere.Client(api_key=COHERE_API_KEY)\n```\n\n## Data \n\nWe leveraged data from [Washington Department of Transportation](https://wsdot.wa.gov/travel/bicycling-walking/bicycling-washington/bicyclist-laws-safety) and modified to fit the need of this demo. \n\n\n```python\ndocuments = [\n    {\n        \"title\": \"Bicycle law\",\n        \"body\": \"\"\"\n        Traffic Infractions and fees - For all information related to bicycle traffic infractions such as not wearing a helmet and fee information, please visit Section 3b for more information.\n        Riding on the road - When riding on a roadway, a cyclist has all the rights and responsibilities of a vehicle driver (RCW 46.61.755).

See the permanent bike restrictions map for more information. In addition, local governments may adopt ordinances banning cycling on specific roads or on sidewalks within business districts.\n        Children bicycling - Parents or guardians may not knowingly permit bicycle traffic violations by their ward (RCW 46.61.700).\n        Riding side by side - Bicyclists may ride side by side, but not more than two abreast (RCW 46.61.770).\n        Riding at night - For night bicycle riding, a white front light (not a reflector) visible for 500 feet and a red rear reflector are required. A red rear light may be used in addition to the required reflector (RCW 46.61.780).\n        Shoulder vs. bike lane - Bicyclists may choose to ride on the path, bike lane, shoulder or travel lane as suits their safety needs (RCW 46.61.770).\n        Bicycle helmets - Currently, there is no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmets.

Both regular and agentic RAG should be able to answer this question easily. Below is the comparsion of the response. \n\n| Question | Simple Rag | Agentic Rag |  \n|--------------|---------|---------|\n|   Is there a state level law for wearing helmets?  | There is currently no state law requiring the use of helmets when riding a bicycle. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use. | There is currently no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles. | \n\n\n\n\n```python\nquestion1 = \"Is there a state level law for wearing helmets?\"\n```\n\n### Simple RAG \n\n\n```python\noutput = simple_rag(question1, db)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n    top_matched_document 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\\nBody: Curre...\n    Name: combined, dtype: object\n    There is currently no state law requiring the use of helmets when riding a bicycle. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use.\n\n\n### Agentic RAG \n\n\n```python\npreamble = \"\"\"\nYou are an expert assistant that helps users answers question about legal documents and policies.\nUse the provided documents to answer questions about an employee's specific situation.\n\"\"\"\n\noutput = cohere_agent(question1, preamble, tools, verbose=True)\n```\n\n    \n    running 0th step.\n    I will search for 'state level law for wearing helmets' in the documents provided and write an answer based on what I find.\n    \n    running 1th step.\n    = running tool retrieve_documents, with parameters: \n    {'query': 'state level law for wearing helmets'}\n    == tool results:\n    {'top_matched_document': 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\\nBody: Curre...\n    Name: combined, dtype: object}\n    There is currently no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles.\n\n\n## Question 2 - double-stage retrieval \n\nThe second question requires a double-stage retrieval because top matched document references another document. You will see below that the agentic RAG is unable to produce the correct answer initially. But when given proper tools and instructions, it finds the correct answer. \n\n\n| Question | Simple Rag | Agentic Rag |  \n|--------------|---------|---------|\n|I live in orting, do I need to wear a helmet with a bike?|In the state of Washington, there is no law requiring you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use, so it is worth checking your local laws.|Yes, you do need to wear a helmet with a bike in Orting if you are under 17.|\n\n\n```python\nquestion2 = \"I live in orting, do I need to wear a helmet with a bike?\"\n```\n\n### Simple RAG \n\n\n```python\noutput = simple_rag(question2, db)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n    top_matched_document 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\\nBody: Curre...\n    Name: combined, dtype: object\n    In the state of Washington, there is no law requiring you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use, so it is worth checking your local laws.\n\n\n### Agentic RAG\n\nProduces same quality answer as the simple rag.\n\n\n```python\npreamble = \"\"\"\nYou are an expert assistant that helps users answers question about legal documents and policies.\nUse the provided documents to answer questions about an employee's specific situation.\n\"\"\"\n\noutput = cohere_agent(question2, preamble, tools, verbose=True)\n```\n\n    \n    running 0th step.\n    I will search for 'helmet with a bike' and then write an answer.\n    \n    running 1th step.\n    = running tool retrieve_documents, with parameters: \n    {'query': 'helmet with a bike'}\n    == tool results:\n    {'top_matched_document': 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\\nBody: Curre...\n    Name: combined, dtype: object}\n    There is no state law requiring helmet use, however, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles. I cannot find any information about Orting specifically, but you should check with your local authority.\n\n\n### Agentic RAG - New Tools \n\nIn order for the model to retrieve correct documents, we do two things: \n1. New reference_extractor() function is added. This function finds the references to other documents when given query and documents. \n2. We update the instruction that directs the agent to keep retrieving relevant documents. \n\n\n```python\ndef reference_extractor(query: str, documents: list[str]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a query and document, find references to other documents.\n    \"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    # instruction\n    Does the reference document mention any other documents? If so, list them.\n    If not, return empty string.\n\n    # user query\n    {query}\n\n    # retrieved documents\n    {documents}\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return co.chat(message=prompt, model=COHERE_MODEL, preamble=None).text\n\n\ndef retrieve_documents(query: str, n=1) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to retrieve most relevant documents a given query.\n    It also returns other references mentioned in the top matched documents.\n    \"\"\"\n    query_emb = co.embed(\n        texts=[query], model=\"embed-english-v3.0\", input_type=\"search_query\"\n    )\n\n    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(\n        [query_emb.embeddings[0]], db.embeddings.tolist()\n    )\n    similarity_scores = similarity_scores[0]\n\n    top_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[::-1][:n]\n    top_matches = db.iloc[top_indices]\n    other_references = reference_extractor(query, top_matches.combined.tolist())\n\n    return {\n        \"top_matched_document\": top_matches.combined,\n        \"other_references_to_query\": other_references,\n    }\n\n\nfunctions_map = {\n    \"retrieve_documents\": retrieve_documents,\n}\n\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"retrieve_documents\",\n        \"description\": \"given a query, retrieve documents from a database to answer user's question.
