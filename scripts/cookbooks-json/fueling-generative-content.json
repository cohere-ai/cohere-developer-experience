But they don’t take into account user search demand and trends. In this notebook, let’s see how we can solve that by adding keyword research into the equation.\n\nRead the accompanying [blog post here](https://cohere.com/blog/generative-content-keyword-research/).\n\n```python\n! pip install cohere -q\n```\n\n```python\nimport cohere\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nimport cohere\nco = cohere.Client(\"COHERE_API_KEY\") # Get your API key: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n```python\n#@title Enable text wrapping in Google Colab\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, display\n\ndef set_css():\n  display(HTML('''\n  <style>\n    pre {\n        white-space: pre-wrap;\n    }\n  </style>\n  '''))\nget_ipython().events.register('pre_run_cell', set_css)\n```\n\nFirst, we need to get a supply of high-traffic keywords for a given topic. We can get this via keyword research tools, of which are many available. We’ll use Google Keyword Planner, which is free to use.\n\n```python\n\nimport wget\nwget.download(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/main/notebooks/data/remote_teams.csv\", \"remote_teams.csv\")\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n```\n'remote_teams.csv'\n```\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('remote_teams.csv')\ndf.columns = [\"keyword\",\"volume\"]\ndf.head()\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n```\n.dataframe tbody tr th {\n    vertical-align: top;\n}\n\n.dataframe thead th {\n    text-align: right;\n}\n```\n\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>keyword</th>\n      <th>volume</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>managing remote teams</td>\n      <td>1000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>remote teams</td>\n      <td>390</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>collaboration tools for remote teams</td>\n      <td>320</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>online games for remote teams</td>\n      <td>320</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>how to manage remote teams</td>\n      <td>260</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\nWe now have a list of keywords, but this list is still raw. For example, “managing remote teams” is the top-ranking keyword in this list. But at the same time, there are many similar keywords further down in the list, such as “how to effectively manage remote teams.”\n\nWe can do that by clustering them into topics. For this, we’ll leverage Cohere’s Embed endpoint and scikit-learn.\n\n### Embed the Keywords with Cohere Embed\n\nThe Cohere Embed endpoint turns a text input into a text embedding.\n\n```python\ndef embed_text(texts):\n  output = co.embed(\n                texts=texts,\n                model='embed-english-v3.0',\n                input_type=\"search_document\",\n                )\n  return output.embeddings\n\nembeds = np.array(embed_text(df['keyword'].tolist()))\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n### Cluster the Keywords into Topics with scikit-learn\n\nWe then use these embeddings to cluster the keywords. A common term used for this exercise is “topic modeling.” Here, we can leverage scikit-learn’s KMeans module, a machine learning algorithm for clustering.\n\n```python\nNUM_TOPICS = 4\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=NUM_TOPICS, random_state=21, n_init=\"auto\").fit(embeds)\ndf['topic'] = list(kmeans.labels_)\ndf.head()\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n```\n.dataframe tbody tr th {\n    vertical-align: top;\n}\n\n.dataframe thead th {\n    text-align: right;\n}\n```\n\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>keyword</th>\n      <th>volume</th>\n      <th>topic</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>managing remote teams</td>\n      <td>1000</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>remote teams</td>\n      <td>390</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>collaboration tools for remote teams</td>\n      <td>320</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>online games for remote teams</td>\n      <td>320</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>how to manage remote teams</td>\n      <td>260</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n### Generate Topic Names with Cohere Chat\n\nWe use the Chat to generate a topic name for that cluster.\n\n```python\ntopic_keywords_dict = {topic: list(set(group['keyword'])) for topic, group in df.groupby('topic')}\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n```python\ndef generate_topic_name(keywords):\n    # Construct the prompt\n    prompt = f\"\"\"Generate a concise topic name that best represents these keywords.\\\nProvide just the topic name and not any additional details.\n\nKeywords: {', '.join(keywords)}\"\"\"\n    \n    # Call the Cohere API\n    response = co.chat(\n        model='command-r',  # Choose the model size\n        message=prompt,\n        preamble=\"\")\n    \n    # Return the generated text\n    return response.text\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n```python\ntopic_name_mapping = {topic: generate_topic_name(keywords) for topic, keywords in topic_keywords_dict.items()}\n\ndf['topic_name'] = df['topic'].map(topic_name_mapping)\n\ndf.head()\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n```\n.dataframe tbody tr th {\n    vertical-align: top;\n}\n\n.dataframe thead th {\n    text-align: right;\n}\n```\n\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>keyword</th>\n      <th>volume</th>\n      <th>topic</th>\n      <th>topic_name</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>managing remote teams</td>\n      <td>1000</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Remote Team Management</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>remote teams</td>\n      <td>390</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Remote Team Tools and Tips</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>collaboration tools for remote teams</td>\n      <td>320</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>Remote Team Tools and Tips</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>online games for remote teams</td>\n      <td>320</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>Remote Team Fun</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>how to manage remote teams</td>\n      <td>260</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>Remote Team Management</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n```python\nfor topic, name in topic_name_mapping.items():\n    print(f\"Topic {topic}: {name}\")\n```\n\n<style>\n  pre {\n      white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n</style>\n\n```\nTopic 0: Remote Team Management\nTopic 1: Remote Team Tools and Tips\nTopic 2: Remote Team Resources\nTopic 3: Remote Team Fun\n```\n\nNow that we have the keywords nicely grouped into topics, we can proceed to generate the content ideas.\n\n### Take the Top Keywords from Each Topic\n\nHere we can implement a filter to take just the top N keywords from each topic, sorted by the search volume.
