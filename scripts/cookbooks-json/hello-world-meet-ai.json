This is the Hello, World! of language AI, written for developers with little or no background in AI. In fact, we’ll do that by exploring the Hello, World! phrase itself.\n\nRead the accompanying [blog post here](https://cohere.com/blog/hello-world-p1/).\n\n[block:html]\n{\n  \"html\": \"<img src=\\\"https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/images/hello-world/hello-world-feat.png\\\" alt=\\\"Hello World! Meet Language AI\\\"/>\"\n}\n[/block]\n\n\nWe’ll cover three groups of tasks that you will typically work on when dealing with language data, including:\n\n- Generating text\n- Classifying text\n- Analyzing text\n\nThe first step is to install the Cohere Python SDK. Next, create an API key, which you can generate from the Cohere [dashboard](https://os.cohere.ai/register) or [CLI tool](https://docs.cohere.ai/cli-key).\n\n```python\n! pip install cohere altair umap-learn -q\n```\n\n```python\nimport cohere\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport altair as alt\n\nco = cohere.Client(\"COHERE_API_KEY\") # Get your API key: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys\n```\n\nThe Cohere Generate endpoint generates text given an input, called “prompt”. The prompt provides a context of what we want the model to generate text. To illustrate this, let’s start with a simple prompt as the input. \n\n### Try a Simple Prompt\n\n```python\nprompt = \"What is a Hello World program.\"\n\nresponse = co.chat(\n  message=prompt,\n  model='command-r')\n\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\n````\nA \"Hello World\" program is a traditional and simple program that is often used as an introduction to a new programming language. The program typically displays the message \"Hello World\" as its output. The concept of a \"Hello World\" program originated from the book *The C Programming Language* written by Kernighan and Ritchie, where the example program in the book displayed the message using the C programming language. \n\nThe \"Hello World\" program serves as a basic and straightforward way to verify that your development environment is set up correctly and to familiarize yourself with the syntax and fundamentals of the programming language. It's a starting point for learning how to write and run programs in a new language.\n\nThe program's simplicity makes it accessible to programmers of all skill levels, and it's often one of the first programs beginners write when learning to code. The exact implementation of a \"Hello World\" program varies depending on the programming language being used, but the core idea remains the same—to display the \"Hello World\" message. \n\nHere's how a \"Hello World\" program can be written in a few select languages:\n1. **C**:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n2. **Python**:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n3. **Java**:\n```java\nclass HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n```\n4. **JavaScript**:\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\");\n```\n5. **C#**:\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThe \"Hello World\" program is a testament to the power of programming, as a simple and concise message can be displayed in numerous languages with just a few lines of code. It's an exciting first step into the world of software development!\n````\n\n### Create a Better Prompt\n\nThe output is not bad, but it can be better. We need to find a way to make the output tighter to how we want it to be, which is where we leverage _prompt engineering_.\n\n```python\nprompt = \"\"\"\nWrite the first paragraph of a blog post given a blog title.\n--\nBlog Title: Best Activities in Toronto\nFirst Paragraph: Looking for fun things to do in Toronto? When it comes to exploring Canada's\nlargest city, there's an ever-evolving set of activities to choose from.

The famous first program, \"Hello, World!\" is a rite of passage for all coders, and an excellent starting point to begin your coding journey. This blog will guide you through the process of writing your very first line of code, and help you understand why learning to code is an exciting and valuable skill to have, covering the fundamentals and the broader implications of this seemingly simple phrase.\n```\n\n### Automating the Process\n\nIn real applications, you will likely need to produce these text generations on an ongoing basis, given different inputs. Let’s simulate that with our example.\n\n```python\ndef generate_text(topic):\n  prompt = f\"\"\"\nWrite the first paragraph of a blog post given a blog title.\n--\nBlog Title: Best Activities in Toronto\nFirst Paragraph: Looking for fun things to do in Toronto?

Embeddings represent text in the form of numbers that capture its meaning and context. What it means is that it gives you the ability to turn unstructured text data into a structured form. It opens up ways to analyze and extract insights from them.\n\n## Get embeddings\n\nHere we have a list of 50 top web search keywords about Hello, World! taken from a keyword tool. Let’s look at a few examples:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/data/hello-world-kw.csv\", names=[\"search_term\"])\ndf.head()\n```\n\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n```\n.dataframe tbody tr th {\n    vertical-align: top;\n}\n\n.dataframe thead th {\n    text-align: right;\n}\n```\n\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>search_term</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>how to print hello world in python</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>what is hello world</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>how do you write hello world in an alert box</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>how to print hello world in java</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>how to write hello world in eclipse</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\nWe use the Embed endpoint to get the embeddings for each of these keywords.\n\n```python\ndef embed_text(texts, input_type):\n  \"\"\"\n  Turns a piece of text into embeddings\n  Arguments:\n    text(str): the text to be turned into embeddings\n  Returns:\n    embedding(list): the embeddings\n  \"\"\"\n  # Embed text by calling the Embed endpoint\n  response = co.embed(\n                model=\"embed-english-v3.0\",\n                input_type=input_type,\n                texts=texts)\n  \n  return response.embeddings\n```\n\n```python\ndf[\"search_term_embeds\"] = embed_text(texts=df[\"search_term\"].tolist(),\n                                      input_type=\"search_document\")\ndoc_embeds = np.array(df[\"search_term_embeds\"].tolist())\n```\n\n### Semantic Search\n\nWe’ll look at a couple of example applications. The first example is semantic search. Given a new query, our \"search engine\" must return the most similar FAQs, where the FAQs are the 50 search terms we uploaded earlier.\n\n```python\nquery = \"what is the history of hello world\"\n\nquery_embeds = embed_text(texts=[query],\n                          input_type=\"search_query\")[0]\n```\n\nWe use cosine similarity to compare the similarity of the new query with each of the FAQs\n\n```python\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\ndef get_similarity(target, candidates):\n  \"\"\"\n  Computes the similarity between a target text and a list of other texts\n  Arguments:\n    target(list[float]): the target text\n    candidates(list[list[float]]): a list of other texts, or candidates\n  Returns:\n    sim(list[tuple]): candidate IDs and the similarity scores\n  \"\"\"\n  # Turn list into array\n  candidates = np.array(candidates)\n  target = np.expand_dims(np.array(target),axis=0)\n\n  # Calculate cosine similarity\n  sim = cosine_similarity(target,candidates)\n  sim = np.squeeze(sim).tolist()\n\n  # Sort by descending order in similarity\n  sim = list(enumerate(sim))\n  sim = sorted(sim, key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)\n\n  # Return similarity scores\n  return sim\n```\n\nFinally, we display the top 5 FAQs that match the new query\n\n```python\nsimilarity = get_similarity(query_embeds,doc_embeds)\n\nprint(\"New query:\")\nprint(new_query,'\\n')\n\nprint(\"Similar queries:\")\nfor idx,score in similarity[:5]:\n  print(f\"Similarity: {score:.2f};\", df.iloc[idx][\"search_term\"])\n```\n\n```\nNew query:\nwhat is the history of hello world \n\nSimilar queries:\nSimilarity: 0.58; how did hello world originate\nSimilarity: 0.56; where did hello world come from\nSimilarity: 0.54; why hello world\nSimilarity: 0.53; why is hello world so famous\nSimilarity: 0.53; what is hello world\n```\n\n### Semantic Exploration\n\nIn the second example, we take the same idea as semantic search and take a broader look, which is exploring huge volumes of text and analyzing their semantic relationships.\n\nWe'll use the same 50 top web search terms about Hello, World! There are different techniques we can use to compress the embeddings down to just 2 dimensions while retaining as much information as possible. We'll use a technique called UMAP. And once we can get it down to 2 dimensions, we can plot these embeddings on a 2D chart.\n\n```python\nimport umap\nreducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=49) \numap_embeds = reducer.fit_transform(doc_embeds)\n\ndf['x'] = umap_embeds[:,0]\ndf['y'] = umap_embeds[:,1]\n```\n\n```python\nchart = alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=500).encode(\n  x=\n  alt.X('x',\n      scale=alt.Scale(zero=False),\n      axis=alt.Axis(labels=False, ticks=False, domain=False)\n  ),\n\n  y=\n  alt.Y('y',\n      scale=alt.Scale(zero=False),\n      axis=alt.Axis(labels=False, ticks=False, domain=False)\n  ),\n  \n  tooltip=['search_term']\n  )\n\ntext = chart.mark_text(align='left', dx=15, size=12, color='black'\n          ).encode(text='search_term', color= alt.value('black'))\n\nresult = (chart + text).configure(background=\"#FDF7F0\"\n      ).properties(\n      width=1000,\n      height=700,\n      title=\"2D Embeddings\"\n      )\n\nresult\n```\n\n<style>\n  #altair-viz-bc3a2e547e164d568611a497f555c176.vega-embed {\n    width: 100%;\n    display: flex;\n  }\n\n \n\n<br />\n\n \n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n  \\#altair-viz-bc3a2e547e164d568611a497f555c176.vega-embed details,  \n  #altair-viz-bc3a2e547e164d568611a497f555c176.vega-embed details summary {  \n    position: relative;  \n  }  \n</style>\n\n<div id=\"altair-viz-bc3a2e547e164d568611a497f555c176\"></div>",
