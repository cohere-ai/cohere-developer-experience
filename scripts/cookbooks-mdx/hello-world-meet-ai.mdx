Here we take a quick tour of what’s possible with language AI via Cohere’s Large Language Model (LLM) API. This is the Hello, World! of language AI, written for developers with little or no background in AI. In fact, we’ll do that by exploring the Hello, World! phrase itself.

Read the accompanying [blog post here](https://cohere.com/blog/hello-world-p1/).

<img src="https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/images/hello-world/hello-world-feat.png" alt="Hello World! Meet Language AI"/>


We’ll cover three groups of tasks that you will typically work on when dealing with language data, including:

- Generating text
- Classifying text
- Analyzing text

The first step is to install the Cohere Python SDK. Next, create an API key, which you can generate from the Cohere [dashboard](https://os.cohere.ai/register) or [CLI tool](https://docs.cohere.ai/cli-key).

```python PYTHON
! pip install cohere altair umap-learn -q
```

```python PYTHON
import cohere
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import altair as alt

co = cohere.Client("COHERE_API_KEY") # Get your API key: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys
```

The Cohere Generate endpoint generates text given an input, called “prompt”. The prompt provides a context of what we want the model to generate text. To illustrate this, let’s start with a simple prompt as the input. 

### Try a Simple Prompt

```python PYTHON
prompt = "What is a Hello World program."

response = co.chat(
  message=prompt,
  model='command-r')

print(response.text)
```

````
A "Hello World" program is a traditional and simple program that is often used as an introduction to a new programming language. The program typically displays the message "Hello World" as its output. The concept of a "Hello World" program originated from the book *The C Programming Language* written by Kernighan and Ritchie, where the example program in the book displayed the message using the C programming language. 

The "Hello World" program serves as a basic and straightforward way to verify that your development environment is set up correctly and to familiarize yourself with the syntax and fundamentals of the programming language. It's a starting point for learning how to write and run programs in a new language.

The program's simplicity makes it accessible to programmers of all skill levels, and it's often one of the first programs beginners write when learning to code. The exact implementation of a "Hello World" program varies depending on the programming language being used, but the core idea remains the same—to display the "Hello World" message. 

Here's how a "Hello World" program can be written in a few select languages:
1. **C**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```
2. **Python**:
```python PYTHON
print("Hello World")
```
3. **Java**:
```java JAVA
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
4. **JavaScript**:
```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```
5. **C#**:
```csharp
using System;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
}
```
The "Hello World" program is a testament to the power of programming, as a simple and concise message can be displayed in numerous languages with just a few lines of code. It's an exciting first step into the world of software development!
````

### Create a Better Prompt

The output is not bad, but it can be better. We need to find a way to make the output tighter to how we want it to be, which is where we leverage _prompt engineering_.

```python PYTHON
prompt = """

Cohere’s Classify endpoint makes it easy to take a list of texts and predict their categories, or classes. A typical machine learning model requires many training examples to perform text classification, but with the Classify endpoint, you can get started with as few as 5 examples per class.

### Sentiment Analysis

```python PYTHON
from cohere import ClassifyExample

examples = [
    ClassifyExample(text="I’m so proud of you", label="positive"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="What a great time to be alive", label="positive"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="That’s awesome work", label="positive"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="The service was amazing", label="positive"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="I love my family", label="positive"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="They don't care about me", label="negative"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="I hate this place", label="negative"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard", label="negative"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="I am really frustrated", label="negative"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="This is so unfair", label="negative"),
    ClassifyExample(text="This made me think", label="neutral"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="The good old days", label="neutral"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="What's the difference", label="neutral"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="You can't ignore this", label="neutral"), 
    ClassifyExample(text="That's how I see it", label="neutral")
]
```

```python PYTHON

        "It was a great time with great people",
        "Great place to work",

Cohere’s Embed endpoint takes a piece of text and turns it into a vector embedding. Embeddings represent text in the form of numbers that capture its meaning and context. What it means is that it gives you the ability to turn unstructured text data into a structured form. It opens up ways to analyze and extract insights from them.

## Get embeddings

Here we have a list of 50 top web search keywords about Hello, World! taken from a keyword tool. Let’s look at a few examples:

```python PYTHON
df = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/data/hello-world-kw.csv", names=["search_term"])
df.head()
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

```
.dataframe tbody tr th {
    vertical-align: top;
}

.dataframe thead th {
    text-align: right;
}
```

</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>search_term</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>how to print hello world in python</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>what is hello world</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>how do you write hello world in an alert box</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>how to print hello world in java</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>how to write hello world in eclipse</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

We use the Embed endpoint to get the embeddings for each of these keywords.

```python PYTHON
def embed_text(texts, input_type):
  """
  Turns a piece of text into embeddings
  Arguments:
    text(str): the text to be turned into embeddings
  Returns:
    embedding(list): the embeddings
  """
  # Embed text by calling the Embed endpoint
  response = co.embed(
                model="embed-english-v3.0",
                input_type=input_type,
                texts=texts)
  
  return response.embeddings
```

```python PYTHON
df["search_term_embeds"] = embed_text(texts=df["search_term"].tolist(),
                                      input_type="search_document")
doc_embeds = np.array(df["search_term_embeds"].tolist())
```

### Semantic Search

We’ll look at a couple of example applications. The first example is semantic search. Given a new query, our "search engine" must return the most similar FAQs, where the FAQs are the 50 search terms we uploaded earlier.

```python PYTHON
query = "what is the history of hello world"

query_embeds = embed_text(texts=[query],
                          input_type="search_query")[0]
```

We use cosine similarity to compare the similarity of the new query with each of the FAQs

```python PYTHON

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def get_similarity(target, candidates):
  """
  Computes the similarity between a target text and a list of other texts
  Arguments:
    target(list[float]): the target text
    candidates(list[list[float]]): a list of other texts, or candidates
  Returns:
    sim(list[tuple]): candidate IDs and the similarity scores
  """
  # Turn list into array
  candidates = np.array(candidates)
  target = np.expand_dims(np.array(target),axis=0)

  # Calculate cosine similarity
  sim = cosine_similarity(target,candidates)
  sim = np.squeeze(sim).tolist()

  # Sort by descending order in similarity
  sim = list(enumerate(sim))
  sim = sorted(sim, key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)

  # Return similarity scores
  return sim
```

Finally, we display the top 5 FAQs that match the new query

```python PYTHON
similarity = get_similarity(query_embeds,doc_embeds)

print("New query:")
print(new_query,'\n')

print("Similar queries:")
for idx,score in similarity[:5]:
  print(f"Similarity: {score:.2f};", df.iloc[idx]["search_term"])
```

```
New query:
what is the history of hello world 

Similar queries:
Similarity: 0.58; how did hello world originate
Similarity: 0.56; where did hello world come from
Similarity: 0.54; why hello world
Similarity: 0.53; why is hello world so famous
Similarity: 0.53; what is hello world
```

### Semantic Exploration

In the second example, we take the same idea as semantic search and take a broader look, which is exploring huge volumes of text and analyzing their semantic relationships.

We'll use the same 50 top web search terms about Hello, World! There are different techniques we can use to compress the embeddings down to just 2 dimensions while retaining as much information as possible. We'll use a technique called UMAP. And once we can get it down to 2 dimensions, we can plot these embeddings on a 2D chart.

```python PYTHON
import umap
reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=49) 
umap_embeds = reducer.fit_transform(doc_embeds)

df['x'] = umap_embeds[:,0]
df['y'] = umap_embeds[:,1]
```

```python PYTHON
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=500).encode(
  x=
  alt.X('x',
      scale=alt.Scale(zero=False),
      axis=alt.Axis(labels=False, ticks=False, domain=False)
  ),

  y=
  alt.Y('y',
      scale=alt.Scale(zero=False),
      axis=alt.Axis(labels=False, ticks=False, domain=False)
  ),
  
  tooltip=['search_term']
  )

text = chart.mark_text(align='left', dx=15, size=12, color='black'
          ).encode(text='search_term', color= alt.value('black'))

result = (chart + text).configure(background="#FDF7F0"
      ).properties(
      width=1000,
      height=700,
      title="2D Embeddings"
      )

result
```
