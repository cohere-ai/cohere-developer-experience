In this cookbook, we will be demonstrating an approach we use for evaluating summarization tasks using LLM evaluation.

## Get Started

You'll need a Cohere API key to run this notebook. If you don't have a key, head to https://cohere.com/ to generate your key.


```python PYTHON
!pip install cohere datasets --quiet
```


```python PYTHON
import json
import random
import re
from typing import List, Optional

import cohere
from getpass import getpass
from datasets import load_dataset
import pandas as pd

co_api_key = getpass("Enter your Cohere API key: ")
co_model = "command-r"
co = cohere.Client(api_key=co_api_key)
```

As test data, we'll use transcripts from the [QMSum dataset](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/QMSum). Note that in addition to the transcripts, this dataset also contains reference summaries -- we will use only the transcripts as our approach is reference-free.


```python PYTHON
qmsum = load_dataset("MocktaiLEngineer/qmsum-processed", split="validation")
transcripts = [x for x in qmsum["meeting_transcript"] if x is not None]
```


    Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/1095 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]



    Generating validation split:   0%|          | 0/237 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]



    Generating test split:   0%|          | 0/244 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]

## Construct the evaluation dataset

We are interested in evaluating summarization in real-world, enterprise use cases, which typically have two distinguishing features as compared to academic summarization benchmarks:
- Enterprise use cases often focus on specific summarization objectives, e.g. "summarize action items".
- Enterprise use cases often feature specific instruction constraints, e.g. "summarize in bullets with each bullet under 20 words".

Therefore, we must first create a dataset that contains diverse summarization prompts. We will do this programmatically by building prompts from their components, as defined below:
- Prompt = text (e.g. transcript to be summarized) + instruction
- Instruction = instruction objective (e.g. "summarize action items") + modifiers
- Modifiers = format/length modifiers (e.g. "use bullets") + style/tone modifiers (e.g. "do not mention names") + ...

First, we define the prompt that combines the text and instructions. Here, we use a very basic prompt:


```python PYTHON
prompt_template = """## meeting transcript
{transcript}

## instructions
{instructions}"""
```

Next, we build the instructions. Because each instruction may have a different objective and modifiers, we track them using metadata. This will later be required for evaluation (i.e. to know what the prompt is asking).


```python PYTHON

instruction_objectives = {
    "general_summarization": "Summarize the meeting based on the transcript.",
    "action_items": "What are the follow-up items based on the meeting transcript?",
}

format_length_modifiers = {
    "paragraphs_short": {
        "text": "In paragraph form, output your response. Use at least 10 words and at most 50 words in total.",
        "objectives": ["general_summarization"],
        "eval_metadata": {
            "format": "paragraphs",
            "min_length": 10,
            "max_length": 50,
        },
    },
    "paragraphs_medium": {
        "text": "Return the answer in the form of paragraphs. Make sure your answer is between 50 and 200 words long.",
        "objectives": ["general_summarization"],
        "eval_metadata": {
            "format": "paragraphs",
            "min_length": 50,
            "max_length": 200,
        },
    },
    "bullets_short_3": {
        "text": "Format your answer in the form of bullets. Use exactly 3 bullets. Each bullet should be at least 10 words and at most 20 words.",
        "objectives": ["general_summarization", "action_items"],
        "eval_metadata": {
            "format": "bullets",
            "number": 3,
            "min_length": 10,
            "max_length": 20,
        },
    },
    "bullets_medium_2": {
        "text": "In bullets, output your response. Make sure to use exactly 2 bullets. Make sure each bullet is between 20 and 80 words long.",
        "objectives": ["general_summarization", "action_items"],
        "eval_metadata": {
            "format": "bullets",
            "number": 2,
            "min_length": 20,
            "max_length": 80,
        },
    },
}
```

Let's combine the objectives and format/length modifiers to finish building the instructions.


```python PYTHON
instructions = []
for obj_name, obj_text in instruction_objectives.items():
    for mod_data in format_length_modifiers.values():
        for mod_obj in mod_data["objectives"]:
            if mod_obj == obj_name:
                instruction = {
                        "instruction": f"{obj_text} {mod_data['text']}",
                        "eval_metadata": mod_data["eval_metadata"],
                        "objective": obj_name,
                    }
                instructions.append(instruction)

print(json.dumps(instructions[:2], indent=4))
```

    [
        {
            "instruction": "Summarize the meeting based on the transcript. In paragraph form, output your response. Use at least 10 words and at most 50 words in total.",
            "eval_metadata": {
                "format": "paragraphs",
                "min_length": 10,
                "max_length": 50
            },
            "objective": "general_summarization"
        },
        {
            "instruction": "Summarize the meeting based on the transcript. Return the answer in the form of paragraphs. Make sure your answer is between 50 and 200 words long.",
            "eval_metadata": {
                "format": "paragraphs",
                "min_length": 50,
                "max_length": 200
            },
            "objective": "general_summarization"
        }
    ]


Finally, let's build the final prompts by semi-randomly pairing the instructions with transcripts from the QMSum dataset.


```python PYTHON
data = pd.DataFrame(instructions)

transcripts = sorted(transcripts, key=lambda x: len(x), reverse=True)[:int(len(transcripts) * 0.25)]
random.seed(42)
random.shuffle(transcripts)
data["transcript"] = transcripts[:len(data)]

data["prompt"] = data.apply(lambda x: prompt_template.format(transcript=x["transcript"], instructions=x["instruction"]), axis=1)
```


```python PYTHON
data["transcript_token_len"] = [len(x) for x in co.batch_tokenize(data["transcript"].tolist(), model=co_model)]
```


```python PYTHON
print(data["prompt"][0])
```

    ## meeting transcript
    PhD F: As opposed to the rest of us 
    PhD D: Well comment OK I I remind that me my first objective eh in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded But eh tsk comment ehhh comment In that way comment I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh eh one thousand acoustic events eh besides the overlapping zones eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh eh talk eh eh clap eh comment I do not know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the pause n speech 
    Grad G: Oh I do not think we ve been doing it at that level of detail So 
    PhD D: Eh I I I do I do not need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh I I will find eh eh a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh eh acoustic events to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh the false eh hypothesis eh nnn which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh eh difference eh feature 
    PhD A: You know I think some of these that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there s two there I mean if it s a tapping sound you would not necessarily or you know something like that it would be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events 
    Grad G: Well You were not talking about just overlaps were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events 
    PhD D: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone Eh ? comment n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh eh one thousand acoustic events 
    Professor E: How many overlaps were there in it ? No no how many of them were the overlaps of speech though ? 
    PhD D: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five eh in forty five minutes Alm Three hundred overlapping zone With the overlapping zone overlapping speech speech what eh different duration 
    Postdoc B: Does this ? So if you had an overlap involving three people how many times was that counted ? 
    PhD D: three people two people Eh I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background be 
    Professor E: No no but I think what she s asking is pause if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking instead of two did you call that one event ? 
    PhD D: Oh Oh I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event the overlapping zone the period where three speaker or eh are talking together 
    Grad G: So let s say me and Jane are talking at the same time and then Liz starts talking also over all of us How many events would that be ? 
    PhD D: So I do not understand 
    Grad G: So two people are talking comment and then a third person starts talking Is there an event right here ? 
    PhD D: Eh no No no For me is the overlapping zone because because you you have s you have more one eh more one voice eh eh produced in a in in a moment 
    Grad G: So i if two or more people are talking 
    Professor E: OK So I think We just wanted to understand how you are defining it So then in the region between since there there is some continuous region in between regions where there is only one person speaking And one contiguous region like that you are calling an event Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? 
    PhD D: I consider the the nnn the nnn nnn eh the entirety eh eh all all the time there were the voice has overlapped This is the idea But eh I I do not distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker I m not considering eh the the ehm eh the fact of eh eh for example what did you say ? Eh at first eh eh two talkers are eh speaking and eh eh a third person eh join to to that For me it s eh it s eh all overlap zone with eh several numbers of speakers is eh eh the same acoustic event Wi but without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together and the zone with the three speakers 
    Postdoc B: That would j just be one 
    PhD D: Eh with eh a beginning mark and the ending mark Because eh for me is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral I do not mind By the moment by the moment 
    Grad G: Well but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two 
    PhD D: I I do not but eh but eh I have to study comment What will happen in a general way 
    Grad G: So You had to start somewhere 
    PhD C: So there s a lot of overlap 
    PhD D: I I do not know what eh will will happen with the 
    Grad G: That s a lot of overlap 
    Professor E: So again that s that s three three hundred in forty five minutes that are that are speakers just speakers 
    Postdoc B: But a a a th 
    Professor E: So that s about eight per minute 
    Postdoc B: But a thousand events in twelve minutes that s 
    PhD C: But that can include taps 
    Postdoc B: Well but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot 
    PhD D: I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh the silent too 
    Grad G: Silence starting or silence ending 
    PhD D: silent ground to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech In ge in in in a general point of view 
    Professor E: OK so how many of those thousand were silence ? 
    PhD F: Not speech not speech or too much speech 
    Professor E: Right So how many of those thousand were silence silent sections ? 
    PhD D: silent I I I I do not I I have not the eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study
    
    ## instructions
    Summarize the meeting based on the transcript. In paragraph form, output your response. Use at least 10 words and at most 50 words in total.

## Build the evaluation framework

We now setup the tools we will use for evaluation.

We use three criteria that are graded using LLMs:
- Completeness: checks if the summary includes all the important information from the original text that it should include
- Correctness: checks if there are any hallucinations or factual inaccuracies in the summary
- Conciseness: checks if the summary includes any unnecessary information or wordiness

In this cookbook, we will use Command-R to grade the completions. However, note that in practice, we typically use an ensemble of multiple LLM evaluators to reduce any bias.


```python PYTHON

grading_prompt_template = """You are an AI grader that given a prompt, a completion, and a criterion, grades the completion based on the prompt and criterion. Below is a prompt, a completion, and a criterion with which to grade the completion. You need to respond according to the criterion instructions.

PROMPT:
{prompt}

COMPLETION:
{completion}

CRITERION:
{criteria}

Do not provide an explanation or respond with additional text. Only respond with the final score in the format SCORE: <final_score>

SCORE:"""


criteria_completeness = """Please judge the above completion on whether or not all the completion fully addresses the task posed in the prompt. The completion should contain all the information that is asked for by the prompt while also upholding the constraints mentioned in the prompt.

- Length: checks if the summary follows the length that was requested in the prompt.

## Run evaluations

Now that we have our evaluation dataset and defined our evaluation functions, let's run evaluations!

First, we generate completions to be graded. We will use Cohere's [Command-R](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01) model, boasting a context length of 128K.


```python PYTHON
completions = []
for prompt in data["prompt"]:
    completion = co.chat(message=prompt, model="command-r", temperature=0.2).text
    completions.append(completion)

data["completion"] = completions
```


```python PYTHON
print(data["completion"][0])
```

    PhD D is transcribing recorded sessions to locate overlapping speech zones and categorizing them as acoustic events. The team discusses the parameters PhD D should use and how to define these events, considering the number of speakers and silence.


Let's grade the completions using our LLM and non-LLM checks.


```python PYTHON
data["format_score"] = data.apply(
    lambda x: score_format(x["completion"], x["eval_metadata"]["format"]), axis=1
)

data["length_score"] = data.apply(
    lambda x: score_length(
        x["completion"],
        x["eval_metadata"]["format"],
        x["eval_metadata"].get("min_length"),
        x["eval_metadata"].get("max_length"),
    ),
    axis=1,
)

data["completeness_score"] = data.apply(
    lambda x: score_llm(x["prompt"], x["completion"], criteria_completeness), axis=1
)

data["correctness_score"] = data.apply(
    lambda x: score_llm(x["prompt"], x["completion"], criteria_correctness), axis=1
)

data["conciseness_score"] = data.apply(
    lambda x: score_llm(x["prompt"], x["completion"], criteria_conciseness), axis=1
)
```


```python PYTHON

Finally, let's print the average scores per critiera.


```python PYTHON
avg_scores = data[["format_score", "length_score", "completeness_score", "correctness_score", "conciseness_score"]].mean()
print(avg_scores)
```

    format_score          1.000000
    length_score          0.833333
    completeness_score    0.800000
    correctness_score     1.000000
    conciseness_score     0.800000
