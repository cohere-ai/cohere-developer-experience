    "Reranking is a crucial technique used in information retrieval systems, particularly for large-scale search applications. The process involves taking an initial set of retrieved documents and reordering them based on how relevant they are to the user's search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most compelling aspects of reranking is its ease of implementation - despite providing substantial improvements to search results, Cohere's Rerank models can be integrated into any existing search system with just a single line of code, regardless of whether it uses semantic or traditional keyword-based search approaches.\n",

    "- Reranking documents\n",
    "- Reranking semi structured data\n",
