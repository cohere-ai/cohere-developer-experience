    "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating text and maintaining conversational context in chat applications. However, LLMs can sometimes hallucinate - producing responses that are factually incorrect. This is particularly important to mitigate in enterprise environments where organizations work with proprietary information that wasn't part of the model's training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enabling LLMs to incorporate external knowledge sources into their response generation process. By grounding responses in retrieved facts, RAG significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the accuracy and reliability of the model's outputs.\n",

    "- Direct response: For user messages that don’t require retrieval (“Hello, I have a question”), the chatbot responds directly without requiring retrieval.\n",
    "- Citation generation: For responses that do require retrieval (\"What's the difference between zero-shot and few-shot prompting\"), the endpoint returns the response together with the citations. These are fine-grained citations, which means they refer to specific spans of the generated text.\n",
    "- State management: The endpoint maintains the state of the conversation via the `chat_history` parameter, for example, by correctly responding to a vague user message, such as \"How would the latter help?\"\n",
    "- Response synthesis: The model can decide if none of the retrieved documents provide the necessary information to answer a user message. For example, when asked the question, “What do you know about 5G networks”, the chatbot retrieves external information from the index. However, it doesn’t use any of the information in its response as none of it is relevant to the question.\n"
