You were just talking about acoustic events \\nPhD D: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone Eh ? comment n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh eh one thousand acoustic events \\nProfessor E: How many overlaps were there in it ? No no how many of them were the overlaps of speech though ? \\nPhD D: How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five eh in forty five minutes Alm Three hundred overlapping zone With the overlapping zone overlapping speech speech what eh different duration \\nPostdoc B: Does this ? So if you had an overlap involving three people how many times was that counted ? \\nPhD D: three people two people Eh I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background be \\nProfessor E: No no but I think what she s asking is pause if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking instead of two did you call that one event ? \\nPhD D: Oh Oh I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event the overlapping zone the period where three speaker or eh are talking together \\nGrad G: So let s say me and Jane are talking at the same time and then Liz starts talking also over all of us How many events would that be ? \\nPhD D: So I do not understand \\nGrad G: So two people are talking comment and then a third person starts talking Is there an event right here ? \\nPhD D: Eh no No no For me is the overlapping zone because because you you have s you have more one eh more one voice eh eh produced in a in in a moment \\nGrad G: So i if two or more people are talking \\nProfessor E: OK So I think We just wanted to understand how you are defining it So then in the region between since there there is some continuous region in between regions where there is only one person speaking And one contiguous region like that you are calling an event Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? \\nPhD D: I consider the the nnn the nnn nnn eh the entirety eh eh all all the time there were the voice has overlapped This is the idea But eh I I do not distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker I m not considering eh the the ehm eh the fact of eh eh for example what did you say ?

Sorry Deputy Minister\\u2014my mistake \\nJulie Morgan AM: Well it is been a very difficult time as you appreciate in terms of having to make legislation very quickly and it has not been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do However I am very pleased to say that we are actually launching a survey of children We are going to be launching it next week And this is to try to get from children their views of what is happened what we have been doing and their views on the whole COVID19 situation So we are doing this in conjunction with the childrens commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament So this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them what they feel about what is happened during this period what they feel about the way that we have dealt with the schools the way that they have had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long And so we are trying to get feedback from young people So I am very pleased that we are doing that but in terms of an impact assessment it has been very difficult as I am sure you can imagine to be able to do those at these times I think that Albert wants to come in on that \\nSuzy Davies AM: Yes because I will pursue that in a sec \\nAlbert Heaney: Thank you Thank you Chair and I think Nicola indicated before me so apologies Nicola Just to say for the committee really importantly that we have not introduced any easements in relation to childrens services legislation I think that is really quite crucial So from a Welsh context the standards that are in place do remain so therefore there would not have been a necessity for us to do a childrens rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation I think that is particularly a strong point to us in Wales both in terms of safeguarding arrangements but also ensuring that childrens rights are protected at a crucial time \\nNicola Edwards: Thanks In terms of childcare and education we are obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those Obviously the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments but in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\\u2014and I think Albert was just saying the same thing\\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward \\nSuzy Davies AM: Well just to come back on that then are you saying to me that as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we have had no assessments for childrens needs have been postponed cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person ? \\nJulie Morgan AM: Well I think as Albert said that there was no relaxation of regulation for childrens social care You know that is\\u2014there have not been any in Wales \\nSuzy Davies AM: No but that is what\\u2014 There is no relaxation but what is happening in practice ? We are down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\\u2014who is doing the childrens needs assessments particularly for young carers ? \\nJulie Morgan AM: Well I\\u2014 Albert can you answer that ? \\nAlbert Heaney: I think the first thing to say to the committee is that going back we took a very strong line at the beginning that we were not going to introduce easements in requirements to childrens social services Of course through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate they are having to operate through a different time So assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns assessments are still taking place and especially in relation to\\u2014as you mentioned\\u2014young carers to support their needs So arrangements\\u2014Inaudible But they are having to be slightly differently done\\u2014so some of the technology and keeping in contact and keeping those visits So we have used for example the St Davids Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well So we are having to be a little bit more\\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they have engaged as well But personal visits are taking place and visits especially as the Minister mentioned earlier on\\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time \\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you I do not want to take this much further but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic I just want to finish with this one question if I may We have had recommendations from the Carers Trust or Carers Trust Wales Have they been accepted by Government and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day Deputy Minister ? \\nJulie Morgan AM: Well those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group I have had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues and we are setting up this group as you know and we will be looking at those issues in the group \\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you Any steal on when that might report ? \\nJulie Morgan AM: I do not have that at the moment \\nLynne Neagle AM: Maybe we could have a note on that Deputy Minister Can I just say we are running short of time ?
