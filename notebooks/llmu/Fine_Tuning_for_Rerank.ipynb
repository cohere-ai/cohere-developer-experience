    "# Fine-Tuning for Rerank\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohere's Rerank endpoint is a sophisticated semantic relevance scoring and ranking system that optimizes search results by evaluating the contextual relationship between queries and passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, complex domains are a special challenge due to their intricate terminology, context, and domain-specific knowledge requirements. These domains include legal documents, medical research papers, scientific literature, technical manuals, developer documentation, code, financial reports, and other fields that demand a deep understanding of specific jargon and intricate concepts. These domains often necessitate fine-tuning on custom data to ensure the models capture the nuances and expertise essential for accurate comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the importance of domain-specific training, we will work with a code example utilizing a dataset in the legal domain. You'll see how fine-tuning can dramatically increase model accuracy."

    "- **Step 1: Prepare the Dataset** - Download the dataset, select a subset, and prepare it for the Rerank endpoint.\n",
    "- **Step 2: Assess the Pre-Trained Model** - Calculate the test accuracy of the pre-trained model.\n",
    "- **Step 3: Fine-Tune the Model** - Kick off a fine-tuning job, and confirm when the model has completed training.\n",
