# Startup Idea Generator App

This is the code companion for the LLMU chapter: [Deploying with Streamlit](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/deploying-with-streamlit) 

This example demonstrated how, using Cohere and Streamlit, you can quickly create a basic prototype of an LLM application.

Before running the app, make sure to install the required dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the app, enter:
```bash
$ streamlit run app.py
```
