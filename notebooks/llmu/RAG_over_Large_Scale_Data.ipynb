Some may return a complete document with tens or hundreds of pages. There are a couple of problems with this. First, stuffing a long document into an LLM prompt means its context limit will be reached, resulting in an error. Second, even if the context limit is not reached, the LLM response will likely not be very good because it is getting a lot of irrelevant information from a long document instead of specific chunks from the document that are the most relevant.\n",

        "- **How to handle multiple documents from multiple connectors and queries?** For a specific connector, the retrieval and reranking implementation is within the developer’s control. But with multiple connectors, that is not possible because these documents are aggregated at the Chat endpoint. As the number of connectors increases, this becomes a bigger problem because we don’t have control over the relevancy of the documents sent to the LLM prompt. And then there is the same problem of possible context limits being reached. Furthermore, if more than one query is generated, the number of documents retrieved will multiply with the same number.\n",
