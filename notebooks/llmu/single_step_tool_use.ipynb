    "In a single-step tool use scenario, an LLM calls a single tool or many tools in parallel. The tools then return the results, and the LLM uses the results to generate its response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we look at single-step tool use and see how tool use works in the following scenarios:\n",
    "-  Multiple tools: What if the model had multiple tools at its disposal? How does the model reason over which tools to use at a particular time?\n",
    "- Parallel tool calls: What does it look like if more than one tool call is required?\n",
    "- When not to use tools: What if a question can, and should, be answered directly by a model without needing a tool?\n",
    "- Tool use in a chat setting: What if the user had follow-up questions, i.e., how does an assistant maintain the context of a conversation in a multi-turn chat setting?"
