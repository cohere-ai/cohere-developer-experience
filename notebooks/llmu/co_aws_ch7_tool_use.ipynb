    "With a tool use approach, external systems are used to guide an LLM’s response, but by leveraging a much bigger set of tools than what’s possible with RAG. The concept of tool use expands on LLMs' useful feature of being able to act as a reasoning and decision-making engine. Tool use also enables developers to build applications that can take actions, that is, capable of doing both read and write operations on an external system.\n",

The assistant can help answer user questions about the company, search for information from e-mails, and create meeting appointments."
