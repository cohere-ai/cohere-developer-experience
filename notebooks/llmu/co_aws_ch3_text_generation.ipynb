      "   - Simply restart your device. This step can often resolve minor glitches and connectivity issues. Turn your device off, wait for a few seconds, and then turn it back on. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Account Status: \n",
      "   - Ensure that your account is active and in good standing. Sometimes, a suspended or inactive account can lead to connectivity issues. You can log in to your online account or contact our customer support team to confirm your account status. \n",
