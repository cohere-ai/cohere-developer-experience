            "== Dune: Part Two was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant. Legendary CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel, adding that \"there's a logical place to stop the [first] movie before the book is over\".\n",
            "== Dune: Part Two is a 2024 American epic space opera film directed by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. The sequel to Dune (2021), it is the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel Dune by Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides as he unites with the Fremen people of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. TimothÃ©e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film, with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, and LÃ©a Seydoux joining the cast.\n",
            "== Between the release of Dune and the confirmation of Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve started working the script in a way that production could begin immediately once the film was greenlit. By February 2021, Roth created a full treatment for the sequel, with writing beginning that August. He confirmed that Feyd-Rautha would appear in the film, and stated he will be a \"very important character\". In March 2022, Villeneuve had mostly finished writing the screenplay. Craig Mazin and Roth wrote additional literary material for the film.\n",
            "== Eric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in April 2017 for the Dune films, and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve. Game of Thrones language creator David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film in April 2019. Villeneuve and Peterson had created the Chakobsa language, which was used by actors on set. In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as show-runner for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune: Part Two. In June 2020, Greig Fraser said, \"It's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. It's a fully standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see it\".\n",
            "== On October 26, 2021, Legendary officially greenlit Dune: Part Two, with a spokesperson for the company stating, \"We would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Here's to more Dune.\" Production work had occurred back-to-back with the first film, as Villeneuve and his wife Lapointe immediately took a flight to Budapest in order to begin pre-production work. A key point of negotiation prior to greenlighting the sequel was assuring that the sequel would have an exclusive window where it would only be shown theatrically, with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window before it would be available through other channels. Villeneuve said this theatrical exclusivity was a \"non-negotiable condition\", and that \"the theatrical experience is at the very heart of the cinematic language for me\". With Dune:\n",
            "== Development began after Legendary Entertainment acquired film and television rights for the Dune franchise in 2016. Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. Production contracts were only secured for the first film before the second film was greenlit by Legendary in October 2021, subject to the success of the first. Principal photography took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi between July and December 2022.\n",
            "== In November 2016, Legendary Pictures obtained the film and TV rights for the Dune franchise, based on the eponymous 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Mary Parent began discussing with Denis Villeneuve about directing a film adaptation, quickly hiring him after realizing his passion for Dune. In February 2018, Villeneuve was confirmed to be hired as director, and intended to adapt the novel as a two-part film series. Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaption of Stephen King's It in 2017 and 2019. In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed as the film's editor.

            "The film \"largely received rave reviews from critics\", and was praised for its visual effects and cast performances. Some reviews considered it one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 456 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Visually thrilling and narratively epic, Dune: Part Two continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (up from the first film's \"Aâ€“\"), while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 94% overall positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend it.\n",
            "== Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three stars out of four, praising the technical and narrative aspects, writing, \"Even as we marvel at the stunning and immersive and Oscar-level cinematography, editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two, we're reminded at every turn that this is an absolutely bat-bleep [sic] crazy story.\"\n",
            "== of the cinematic language for me\". With Dune: Part Two being greenlit, Villeneuve said that his primary concern was to complete the filming as soon as possible, with the earliest he expected to start in the last quarter of 2022. He noted that production would be expedited by the work already done for the first film.\n"
