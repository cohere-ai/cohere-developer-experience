        "# SQL Agent Demo with Cohere and LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates how to create a SQL agent using Cohere and LangChain. The agent can translate natural language queries coming from users into SQL, and execute them against a database. This powerful combination allows for intuitive interaction with databases without requiring direct SQL knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key topics covered:\n",
        "1. Setting up the necessary libraries and environment\n",
        "2. Connecting to a SQLite database\n",
        "3. Configuring the LangChain SQL Toolkit\n",
        "4. Creating a custom prompt template with few-shot examples\n",
        "5. Building and running the SQL agent\n",
        "6. Adding memory to the agent to keep track of historical messages\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional SQL agent that can answer questions about your data using natural language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial uses a mocked up data of a manufacturing environment where a product item's production is tracked across multiple stations, allowing for analysis of production efficiency, station performance, and individual item progress through the manufacturing process. This is modelled after a real customer use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "The database contains two tables:\n",
        "- The `product_tracking` table records the movement of items through different zones in manufacturing stations, including start and end times, station names, and product IDs.\n",
        "- The `status` table logs the operational status of stations, including timestamps, station names, and whether they are productive or in downtime.\n"
