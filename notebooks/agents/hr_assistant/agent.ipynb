    "In this cookbook, we will demonstrate an implementation of an agentic chatbot that facilitates HR operations at a fictionalized version of Cohere. Through its tools, the chatbot is able to retrieve and act upon relevant information and fetch data from external data sources (such as a database or API)."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by setting up our imports and tool definitions. We provide our agent with mock data on Cohere employees, along with these tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python_tool`: allow the model to write and execute Python code\n",
    "- `get_info_employee`: fetch information regarding a (mock) Cohere employee from a database\n",
    "- `search_cohere_policies`: fetch relevant documents about Cohere's HR policies\n",
    "- `get_employee_timezone`: fetch current UTC offset for a location\n",
    "- `internet_search`: browse the internet to find relevant information for the query\n",
    "- `get_template`: get the template for a specific kind of communication, such as offer to a candidate, refusal, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the code below, we keep the definitions of these tools in the `tools.py` file. For this cookbook, you will also need two API keys: one from Cohere, and one from [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) to allow the model to search the internet. You can create a `.env` file in this directory to store these."
