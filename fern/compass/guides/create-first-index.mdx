# Step 1: Import dependencies
```python PYTHON
from cohere.compass.clients.compass import CompassClient
from cohere.compass.clients.parser import CompassParserClient
from cohere.compass.clients import ParserConfig, scan_folder
```

# Step 2: Create Clients

```python PYTHON
# Create Clients
api_url = "http://compass-api-stg-compass:8080"
parser_url = "http://compass-parser-stg-compass:8083"

# Your bearer token
user_token = "{Your API Token}"

co_compass = CompassClient(index_url=api_url, bearer_token=user_token)
co_parser = CompassParserClient(parser_url=parser_url)
```

# Step 3: Create Your First Index

```python PYTHON
index = 'my_first_compass_index'

# Create your first index
res = co_compass.create_index(index_name=index)
```

Now that youâ€™ve created your index, you should check that index exists

```python PYTHON
# Check to see if your index has been created
res = co_compass.list_indexes()

result = next((d for d in res.result['indexes'] if d['name'] == index), None)

result
```

At this point in time you should received something like this: 

`{'name': 'my_first_compass_index', 'count': 0, 'parent_doc_count': 0}`

At this point you should have your first index created which is empty. The count refers to the number of chunks in the index, and the parent_doc_count refers to the number of files inserted into the index. For now, both should be 0.

# Step 4: Parse and Insert Documents into your Index

Download the sample files and put them into a local directory

```python PYTHON
# Get your file directory
index_data = '{Your File Path}'

# Grabbing the file paths to each file in our local folder
files = scan_folder(folder_path=index_data, recursive=True)

for file in files:
    # Each file should call the parser to be processed
    parsed_chunks=co_parser.process_file(filename=file)
    # Each file is pre-processed into Compass Chunks which are then inserted into the Index
    res=co_compass.insert_docs(
        index_name=index,
        docs=parsed_chunks
    )
```

Now that the documents have been inserted into your index, you can check the status of your index

```python PYTHON
# Check to see if the files have been indexed
res = co_compass.list_indexes()

result = next((d for d in res.result['indexes'] if d['name'] == index), None)

result
```

At this point in time, if you indexed the sample documents you should receive something like this: 

`{'name': 'my_first_compass_index', 'count': 258, 'parent_doc_count': 3}`

# Step 5: Searching

We will conduct a preliminary search against your index using the `search_chunks` method

```python PYTHON
# Conducting your first search
query = "How do I set up a new android device if I already have one?"

results = co_compass.search_chunks(query=query,index_name=index,top_k=3)

for index, i in enumerate (results.hits):
    print (f"Position: {index} | File Name: {i.origin['filename']} | Page Number: {i.origin['page_number']}")
    print(f"Content: {i.content['text']}\n")
```

# Step 6: Clean-Up

```python PYTHON
# Clean up the index
res=co_compass.delete_index(index_name=index)
res
```

# Conclusion:

You have now inserted your first documents into a Compass index. The total number of chunks will differ from the total number of parent documents which respects the number of files inserted into an index.
