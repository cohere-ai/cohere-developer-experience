The Compass Python SDK is available in an open source repo found here. The `README` contains additional examples, and you are even free to contribute back or fork the code if there are improvements specific to your use cases.

## Install via Pip
To setup a python environment and install the compass SDK into it, you will need a version of python3.11 or higher. From that base requirement, you can install following these commands:
```
python3 -m venv sdk-env  
source sdk-env/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-compass-sdk.git@0.12.0
```
## Add to requirements.txt
It may also be added to a `requirements.txt` file pinned to a version with the following line:
`git+https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-compass-sdk.git@v0.12.0`

## Add to Poetry Project
To include in a poetry project, you can modify the `pyproject.toml` to contain:
```
...
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
compass-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-compass-sdk.git", rev = "v0.12.0" }
```
