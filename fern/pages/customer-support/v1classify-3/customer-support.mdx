Customer support tickets can come from all directions, and manually analyzing and routing information is an overwhelming job. A text classification system can help support teams accelerate this process. It can augment a teamâ€™s capacity by automatically assigning each ticket to the right type or next action.

Here we look at an example of classifying customer emails to an insurance company into four types of requests, `Finding policy details`, `Change account settings`, `Filing a claim and viewing status`, and `Cancelling coverage`.
