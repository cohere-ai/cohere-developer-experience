### Colab Notebook

This chapter comes with a corresponding <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/Basic_Semantic_Search.ipynb">Colab notebook</a>, and we encourage you to follow it along as you read the chapter.

For the setup, please refer to the <a target="_blank" href="/docs/setting-up">Setting Up</a> chapter at the beginning of this module.

### Introduction

In module 2, you learned about <a target="_blank" href="/docs/semantic-search">semantic search</a>, and then in a previous chapter in this module, you built a simple semantic search model using text embeddings. In this chapter, you'll build a similar semantic search model in a much larger dataset, which is made up of questions. Since the dataset is larger, we'll use a tool that will speed up the nearest neighbors algorithm here.

As you've seen before, semantic search goes way beyond keyword search. The applications of semantic search go beyond building a web search engine. They can empower a private search engine for internal documents or records. It can be used to power features like StackOverflow's "similar questions" feature.

### Contents

- Get the archive of questions
- Embed the archive
- Search using an index and nearest neighbour search
- Visualize the archive based on the embeddings.

### 1. Download the Dependencies

```python PYTHON
# title Import libraries (Run this cell to execute required code) {display-mode: "form"}

import cohere
import numpy as np
import re
import pandas as pd
from tqdm import tqdm
from datasets import load_dataset
import umap
import altair as alt
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
pd.set_option("display.max_colwidth", None)
```

### 2. Get the Archive of Questions

We'll use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/trec">trec</a> dataset which is made up of questions and their categories.

```python PYTHON
# Get dataset
dataset = load_dataset("trec", split="train")
# Import into a pandas dataframe, take only the first 1000 rows
df = pd.DataFrame(dataset)[:1000]
# Preview the data to ensure it has loaded correctly
df.head(10)
```

### 3. Embed the Archive

<img src="../../../assets/images/3180a95-image.png" />

Let's now embed the text of the questions.

To get a thousand embeddings of this length should take a few seconds.

```python PYTHON
# Paste your API key here. Remember to not share publicly
api_key = ""

# Create and retrieve a Cohere API key from dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/register
co = cohere.Client(api_key)

# Get the embeddings
embeds = co.embed(
    texts=list(df["text"]), model="embed-english-v2.0"
).embeddings
```

### 4. Build the Index, search Using an Index and Conduct Nearest Neighbour Search

<img src="../../../assets/images/59f2756-image.png" />

Let's build an index using the library called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy">annoy</a>. Annoy is a library created by Spotify to do <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nearest_neighbor_search">nearest neighbour search</a>; nearest neighbour search is an optimization problem of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point.

```python PYTHON
# Create the search index, pass the size of embedding
search_index = AnnoyIndex(np.array(embeds).shape[1], "angular")
# Add all the vectors to the search index
for i in range(len(embeds)):
    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])
search_index.build(10)  # 10 trees
search_index.save("test.ann")
```

After building the index, we can use it to retrieve the nearest neighbours either of existing questions (section 3.1), or of new questions that we embed (section 3.2).

#### 4a. Find the Neighbours of an Example from the Dataset

If we're only interested in measuring the similarities between the questions in the dataset (no outside queries), a simple way is to calculate the similarities between every pair of embeddings we have.

```python PYTHON
# Choose an example (we'll retrieve others similar to it)
example_id = 92
# Retrieve nearest neighbors
similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_item(
    example_id, 10, include_distances=True
)
# Format and print the text and distances
results = pd.DataFrame(
    data={
        "texts": df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]["text"],
        "distance": similar_item_ids[1],
    }
).drop(example_id)
print(f"Question:'{df.iloc[example_id]['text']}'\nNearest neighbors:")
results
```

```python PYTHON
# Output:
Question:'What are bear and bull markets ?'
Nearest neighbors:
```

|     | texts                                          | distance |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| 614 | What animals do you find in the stock market ? | 0.896121 |
| 137 | What are equity securities ?                   | 0.970260 |
| 601 | What is \`\` the bear of beers '' ?            | 0.978348 |
| 307 | What does NASDAQ stand for ?                   | 0.997819 |
| 683 | What is the rarest coin ?                      | 1.027727 |
| 112 | What are the world 's four oceans ?            | 1.049661 |
| 864 | When did the Dow first reach ?                 | 1.050362 |
| 547 | Where can stocks be traded on-line ?           | 1.053685 |
| 871 | What are the Benelux countries ?               | 1.054899 |

#### 4b. Find the Neighbours of a User Query

We're not limited to searching using existing items. If we get a query, we can embed it and find its nearest neighbours from the dataset.

```python PYTHON
query = "What is the tallest mountain in the world?"

# Get the query's embedding
query_embed = co.embed(
    texts=[query], model="embed-english-v2.0"
).embeddings

# Retrieve the nearest neighbors
similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_vector(
    query_embed[0], 10, include_distances=True
)
# Format the results
results = pd.DataFrame(
    data={
        "texts": df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]["text"],
        "distance": similar_item_ids[1],
    }
)


print(f"Query:'{query}'\nNearest neighbors:")
results
```

|     | texts                                                                        | distance |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| 236 | What is the name of the tallest mountain in the world ?                      | 0.431913 |
| 670 | What is the highest mountain in the world ?                                  | 0.436290 |
| 907 | What mountain range is traversed by the highest railroad in the world ?      | 0.715265 |
| 435 | What is the highest peak in Africa ?                                         | 0.717943 |
| 354 | What ocean is the largest in the world ?                                     | 0.762917 |
| 412 | What was the highest mountain on earth before Mount Everest was discovered ? | 0.767649 |
| 109 | Where is the highest point in Japan ?                                        | 0.784319 |
| 114 | What is the largest snake in the world ?                                     | 0.789743 |
| 656 | What 's the tallest building in New York City ?                              | 0.793982 |
| 901 | What 's the longest river in the world ?                                     | 0.794352 |

### 5. Visualize the archive

```python PYTHON
# @title Plot the archive {display-mode: "form"}

# UMAP reduces the dimensions from 1024 to 2 dimensions that we can plot
reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=20)
umap_embeds = reducer.fit_transform(embeds)
# Prepare the data to plot and interactive visualization
# using Altair
df_explore = pd.DataFrame(data={"text": df["text"]})
df_explore["x"] = umap_embeds[:, 0]
df_explore["y"] = umap_embeds[:, 1]

# Plot
chart = (
    alt.Chart(df_explore)
    .mark_circle(size=60)
    .encode(
        x=alt.X("x", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),  #'x',
        y=alt.Y("y", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
        tooltip=["text"],
    )
    .properties(width=700, height=400)
)
chart.interactive()
```

### Conclusion

This concludes this introductory guide to semantic search using sentence embeddings. As you continue the path of building a search product additional considerations arise (like dealing with long texts, or training to better improve the embeddings for a specific use case).
