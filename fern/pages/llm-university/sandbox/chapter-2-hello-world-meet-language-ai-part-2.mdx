If you are a developer looking to add language processing capabilities to your project, this guide is for you. We’ll give you a quick tour of what’s possible with language AI using Cohere’s Large Language Model (LLM) API. This module and the next one are essentially your “Hello, World!” of language AI, and since this is all about language processing, we’ll do this by exploring the phrase Hello, World! itself!

Three important tasks you'll be dealing with when working with language data are the following:

- Classifying text
- Analyzing text
- Generating text

These map nicely to three Cohere endpoints — [Generate](/reference/generate), [Classify](/reference/classify), and [Embed](/reference/embed).

Classifying and Analyzing text will be covered in this module, and the entire Module 4 will be dedicated to Generating text.

This chapter assumes little or no background in machine learning or NLP, but if you'd like to refresh on any concepts, we'll provide the right links to Modules 1 and 2. The examples are shown using Python, although Cohere also provides SDKs for Node.js, Go, and Ruby (to learn how to deploy in these platforms, please check Module 6 of this course). We include only key snippets of the code used, but you can run the full version if you wish. It is hosted on Google Colaboratory, so you won’t need to go through additional setup or installation.
