Before we proceed, letâ€™s use a toolbox metaphor to try and make sense of the commonly used terms and how they compare to each other:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The toolkit for using computers to process, understand, and generate text.
- **Language AI**: A set of modern tools within that toolkit which leverage machine learning models. Some examples include text generation, classification, summarization, paraphrasing, and entity extraction.
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: A general-purpose type of language AI that eliminates the need for different models for different tasks. It has also achieved state-of-the-art performance in some NLP tasks. These are the kind of models you interact with using the Cohere platform.

Over the next few modules, you'll be learning these more in detail. Happy learning!
