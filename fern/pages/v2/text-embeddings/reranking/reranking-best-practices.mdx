## Document Chunking

Cohere's Rerank models follow a particular procedure to chunk documents, which will look something like this:

- Take the context window;
- Subtract the reserved tokens (the number of reserved tokens changes per model)

For `rerank-v4.0`, the model breaks documents into 32,764-token chunks (this is the context length of 32,768 minus four special, reserved tokens.) For example, if your query is 100 tokens and your document is 100,000 tokens, your document will be broken into the following chunks:

1. `relevance_score_1 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[0,32663]>`
2. `relevance_score_2 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[32664,65327]>`
3. `relevance_score_3 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[65328,97990]>`
4. `relevance_score_4 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[97991,99999]>`
5. `relevance_score = max(relevance_score_1, relevance_score_2, relevance_score_3, relevance_score_4)`

For `rerank-v3.5` and `rerank-v3.0`, the process is the same except the models break documents into 4093 token chunks; if your query is 100 tokens and your document is 10,000 tokens, for example, it will be broken into the following chunks:

1. `relevance_score_1 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[0,3992]>`
2. `relevance_score_2 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[3993,7985]>`
3. `relevance_score_3 = <padding_tokens, query[0,99], document[7986,9999]>`
4. `relevance_score = max(relevance_score_1, relevance_score_2, relevance_score_3)`

If you would like more control over how chunking is done, we recommend that you chunk your documents yourself.

## Queries

Our `rerank-v4.0` models (both 'light' and 'super') are trained with a context length of 32768 tokens. The model takes both the _query_ and the _document_ into account when calculating against this limit, and the query can account for up to half of the full context length. If your query is larger than 16,384 tokens, in other words, it will be truncated to the first 16,384 tokens (leaving the other 16,384 for the document(s)).

Our `rerank-v3.5` and `rerank-v3.0` models, are trained with a context length of 4096 tokens, so the process is the same while the math is different. If your query is larger than 2048 token, it will be truncated to the first 2048 tokens (leaving the other 2048 for the document(s)).

## Structured Data Support

Our Rerank models support reranking structured data formatted as a list of YAML strings. Note that since long document strings get truncated, the order of the keys is especially important. When constructing the YAML string from a dictionary, make sure to maintain the order. In Python that is done by setting `sort_keys=False` when using `yaml.dump`.

Example:
```python
import yaml

docs = [
    {
        "Title": "How to fix a dishwasher",
        "Author": "John Smith",
        "Date": "August 1st 2023",
        "Content": "Fixing a dishwasher depends on the specific problem you're facing. Here are some common issues and their potential solutions:....",
    },
    {
        "Title": "How to fix a leaky sink",
        "Date": "July 25th 2024",
        "Content": "Fixing a leaky sink will depend on the source of the leak. Here are general steps you can take to address common types of sink leaks:.....",
    },
]

yaml_docs = [yaml.dump(doc, sort_keys=False) for doc in docs]
```

## Interpreting Results

The most important output from the [Rerank API endpoint](/reference/rerank-1) is the absolute rank exposed in the response object. The score is query dependent, and could be higher or lower depending on the query and passages sent in. In the example below, what matters is that Ottawa is more relevant than Toronto, but the user should not assume that Ottawa is two times more relevant than Ontario.

```
[
	RerankResult<text: Ottawa, index: 1, relevance_score: 0.9109375>,
	RerankResult<text: Toronto, index: 2, relevance_score: 0.7128906>,
	RerankResult<text: Ontario, index: 3, relevance_score: 0.04421997>
]
```

Relevance scores are normalized to be in the range `[0, 1]`. Scores close to `1` indicate a high relevance to the query, and scores closer to `0` indicate low relevance. To find a threshold on the scores to determine whether a document is relevant or not, we recommend going through the following process:

- Select a set of 30-50 representative queries `Q=[q_0, … q_n]` from your domain.
- For each query provide a document that is considered borderline relevant to the query for your specific use case, and create a list of (query, document) pairs: `sample_inputs=[(q_0, d_0), …, (q_n, d_n)]` .
- Pass all tuples in `sample_inputs` through the rerank endpoint in a loop, and gather relevance scores `sample_scores=[s0, ..., s_n]`.

The average of `sample_scores` can then be used as a reference when deciding a threshold for filtering out irrelevant documents.
