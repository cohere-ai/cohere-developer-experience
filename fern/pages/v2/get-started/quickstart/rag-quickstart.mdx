RAG enables a model to utilize information from external documents, thereby improving the accuracy of its responses and minimizing hallucinations.

<Steps>
### Setup
This quickstart example uses the `cohere` Python SDK. Install with the following command:

```bash
pip install -U cohere
```

Next, import the library and create a client.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cohere Platform">

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.ClientV2("COHERE_API_KEY") # Get your free API key here: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Private Deployment">

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="", # Leave this blank
                     base_url="<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL>")
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Documents

First, define the documents that will passed as the context for RAG. These documents are typically retrieved from sources such as vector databases via semantic search, or any system that can retrieve unstructured data given a user query.

Each document is a `data` object that can take any number of fields e.g. `title`, `url`, `text`, etc.

```python PYTHON
documents = [
    {
        "data": {
            "text": "Reimbursing Travel Expenses: Easily manage your travel expenses by submitting them through our finance tool. Approvals are prompt and straightforward."
        }
    },
    {
        "data": {
            "text": "Working from Abroad: Working remotely from another country is possible. Simply coordinate with your manager and ensure your availability during core hours."
        }
    },
    {
        "data": {
            "text": "Health and Wellness Benefits: We care about your well-being and offer gym memberships, on-site yoga classes, and comprehensive health insurance."
        }
    },
]

```
### Response Generation

Next, call the Chat API by passing the documents in the `documents` parameter. This tells the model to run in RAG-mode and use these documents as the context in its response.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cohere Platform">
```python PYTHON
# Add the user query
query = "Are there health benefits?"

# Generate the response
response = co.chat(
    model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': query}],
    documents=documents
)

# Display the response
print(response.message.content[0].text)
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Private Deployment">
```python PYTHON
# Add the user query
query = "Are there health benefits?"

# Generate the response
response = co.chat(
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': query}],
    documents=documents
)

# Display the response
print(response.message.content[0].text)
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

```mdx wordWrap
Yes, there are health benefits. We offer gym memberships, on-site yoga classes, and comprehensive health insurance.
```

### Citation Generation

The response object contains a `citations` field, which contains specific text spans from the documents on which the response is grounded.

```python PYTHON
if response.message.citations:
    for citation in response.message.citations:
        print(citation, "\n")
```

```mdx wordWrap
start=14 end=88 text='gym memberships, on-site yoga classes, and comprehensive health insurance.' document_ids=['doc_1'] 

```
