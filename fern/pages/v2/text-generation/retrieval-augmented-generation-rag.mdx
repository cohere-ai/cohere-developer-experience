Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method for generating text using additional information fetched from an external data source, which can greatly increase the accuracy of the response. When used in conjunction with a [Command](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-beta), [Command R](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r), or [Command R+](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus), the [Chat API](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat) makes it easy to generate text that is grounded on supplementary information.

To call the Chat API with RAG, create a `user` message containing two content fields:
- `content` for the user's query.
- `documents` for storing all the documents.

The `documents` field consists of a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a document. A document can have different fields depending on its nature, such as `title`, `text`, `url`, etc. Optionally, you can also pass your own IDs for each document using the `id` field. Otherwise, the API will automatically generate the IDs based on the documents position in the list.

Then pass this `user` message to the `messages` parameter in the Chat endpoint call.

The code snippet below, for example, will produce a grounded answer to `"Where do the tallest penguins live?"`, along with inline citations based on the provided documents.

**Request**

```python
import cohere
co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

# Retrieve the documents
documents=[
    {"title": "Tall penguins", "snippet": "Emperor penguins are the tallest."},
    {"title": "Penguin habitats", "snippet": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica."},
    {"title": "What are animals?", "snippet": "Animals are different from plants."}
    ]

# Add the user message containing the query and documents
message = "Where do the tallest penguins live?"
messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': message, "documents": documents}]

response = co.chat(
    model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
    messages=messages)

print(response.message.content)

print(response.message.citations)
```
Here is the full content of the `messages` object from the example above, which includes the `documents` as part of the `user` message.

```json
{
  "messages": [{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Where do the tallest penguins live?",
      "documents": [
        {
          "title": "Tall penguins",
          "snippet": "Emperor penguins are the tallest."
        },
        {
          "title": "Penguin habitats",
          "snippet": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica."
        },
        {
          "title": "What are animals?",
          "snippet": "Animals are different from plants."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}]
}
```

The resulting generation is`"The tallest penguins are emperor penguins, which live in Antarctica."`. The model was able to combine partial information from multiple sources and ignore irrelevant documents to arrive at the full answer.

Nice :penguin:❄️!

**Response**

```
# response.message.content
[TextContent(text='The tallest penguins are emperor penguins, which live in Antarctica.', type='text')]
```
```
# response.message.citations
[Citation(start=4, 
          end=41, text='tallest penguins are emperor penguins', sources=[Source_Document(id='doc:0:0', document={'id': 'doc:0:0', 'snippet': 'Emperor penguins are the tallest.', 'title': 'Tall penguins'}, type='document')]), 
          
 Citation(start=57, 
          end=68, 
          text='Antarctica.', 
          sources=[Source_Document(id='doc:0:1', document={'id': 'doc:0:1', 'snippet': 'Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica.', 'title': 'Penguin habitats'}, type='document')])]
```

The response also includes **inline citations**  that reference the first two documents, since they hold the answers.

### Three steps of RAG

The RAG workflow generally consists of **3 steps**:

- **Generating search queries** for finding relevant documents. _What does the model recommend looking up before answering this question? _
- **Fetching relevant documents** from an external data source using the generated search queries. _Performing a search to find some relevant information._
- **Generating a response** with inline citations using the fetched documents. _Using the acquired knowledge to produce an educated answer_.

#### Example: Using RAG to identify the definitive 90s boy band

In this section, we will use the three step RAG workflow to finally settle the score between the notorious boy bands Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. We ask the model to provide an informed answer to the question `"Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?"`

#### Step 1: Generating search queries

First, the model needs to generate an optimal set of search queries to use for retrieval. 

There are different possible approaches to do this. In this example, we'll take a [tool use](v2/docs/tool-use) approach.

Here, we build a tool that takes a user query and returns a list of relevant document snippets for that query. The tool can generate one or multiple search queries depending on the user query.

```python PYTHON
message = "Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?"

query_gen_tool = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "internet_search",
            "description": "Returns a list of relevant document snippets for a textual query retrieved from the internet",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "queries": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {"type": "string"},
                        "description": "a list of queries to search the internet with."
                    }
                },
                "required": ["queries"]
            }
        }
    }
]

instructions = "Write a search query that will find helpful information for answering the user's question accurately. If you need more than one search query, write a list of search queries. If you decide that a search is very unlikely to find information that would be useful in constructing a response to the user, you should instead directly answer."
    
response = co.chat(
    model="command-r-08-2024",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": instructions},
        {"role": "user", "content": message}],
    tools=query_gen_tool,
)

search_queries = []

if response.message.tool_calls:
    search_queries = json.loads(response.message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments)["queries"]
    
print(search_queries)
```

Now, given the query, the following search queries are generated.

```
# Sample response
['popularity of NSync', 'popularity of Backstreet Boys']
```
Indeed, to generate a factually accurate answer to the question "Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?", looking up `popularity of NSync` and `popularity of Backstreet Boys` first would be helpful.

#### Step 2: Fetching relevant documents

The next step is to [fetch documents](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/documents-and-citations) from the relevant data source using the generated search queries. For example, to answer the question about the two pop sensations _NSYNC_ and _Backstreet Boys_, one might want to use an API from a web search engine, and fetch the contents of the websites listed at the top of the search results.

We won't go into details of fetching data in this guide, since it's very specific to the search API you're querying. However we should mention that breaking up long documents into smaller ones first (1-2 paragraphs) will help you not go over the context limit. When trying to stay within the context length limit, you might need to omit some of the documents from the request. To make sure that only the least relevant documents are omitted, we recommend using the [Rerank endpoint](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/rerank) endpoint which will sort the documents by relevancy to the query. The lowest ranked documents are the ones you should consider dropping first.

#### Step 3: Generating a response

In the final step, we will be calling the Chat API again, but this time passing along the `documents` you acquired in Step 2. A `document` object is a dictionary containing the content and the metadata of the text. We recommend using a few descriptive keys such as `"title"`, `"snippet"`, or `"last updated"` and only including semantically relevant data. The keys and the values will be formatted into the prompt and passed to the model.

This concept will not only bring you sales information for all NSYNC‘s albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming, but it will also determine their true popularity. If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully recommend watching the video before getting into the sales figures."

Not only will we discover that the Backstreet Boys were the more popular band, but the model can also _Tell Me Why_, by providing details [supported by citations](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/documents-and-citations).


### Caveats

It’s worth underscoring that RAG does not guarantee accuracy. It involves giving a model context which informs its replies, but if the provided documents are themselves out-of-date, inaccurate, or biased, whatever the model generates might be as well. What’s more, RAG doesn’t guarantee that a model won’t hallucinate. It greatly reduces the risk, but doesn’t necessarily eliminate it altogether. This is why we put an emphasis on including inline citations, which allow users to verify the information.
