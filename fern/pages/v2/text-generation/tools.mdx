Here, you'll find context on using tools with Cohere models: 

-  The [basic usage](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use-overview) discusses 'function calling,' including how to define and create the tool, how to give it a schema, and how to incorporate it into common workflows. 
-  [Usage patterns](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use-usage-patterns) builds on this, covering parallel execution, state management, and more.
-  [Parameter types](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use-parameter-types) talks about structured output in the context of tool use.
-  As its name implies, [Streaming](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use-streaming) explains how to deal with tools when output must be streamed.
-  It's often important to double-check model output, which is made much easier with [citations](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use-citations).


These should help you leverage Cohere's tool use functionality to get the most out of our models.
