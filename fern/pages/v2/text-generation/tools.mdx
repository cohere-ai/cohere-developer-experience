Here, you'll find context on [tool use](v2/docs/tool-use).

Tool use capabilities are sometimes referred to as:
 - "function calling" because it uses functions to call external tools that augment the capabilities of large language models.
 - "agents" because it forms the core of many complexworkflows relying on agents. 

You'll also find additional documentation on the various [types of parameters](v2docs/parameter-types-in-tool-use) offered by Cohere's tool use functionality.
