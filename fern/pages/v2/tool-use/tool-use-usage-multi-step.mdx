## Overview
[[TODO - describe multi-step tool use (agents)]]

The Chat endpoint supports multi-step tool use, which enables the model to perform sequential reasoning. This is especially useful in agentic workflows that require multiple steps to complete a task.

2. Then only it can get the revenue figure now that the company has been identified
