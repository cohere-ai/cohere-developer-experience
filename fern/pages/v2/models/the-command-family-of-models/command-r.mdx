Command R is a large language model optimized for conversational interaction and long context tasks. It targets the “scalable” category of models that balance high performance with strong accuracy, enabling companies to move beyond proof of concept and into production. 

Command R boasts high precision on [retrieval augmented generation](/v2/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG) and tool use tasks, low latency and high throughput, a long 128,000-token context length, and strong capabilities across 10 key languages.

## Command R7B December 2024 Release
Command R7B is the smallest, fastest, and final model in our R family of enterprise-focused [large language models](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/introduction-to-large-language-models) (LLMs). With a context window of 128K, Command R7B offers state-of-the-art performance across a variety of real-world tasks, and is designed for use cases in which speed, cost, and compute are important. Specifically, Command R7B is excellent for:

- RAG - [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG) refers to the practice of ‘grounding’ model outputs in external data sources, which can increase accuracy. Command R7B is exceptionally good at generating responses in conversational tasks, attending over long inputs, and extracting and manipulating numerical information in financial settings.
- Tool-use - With [tool use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use), Command models can be given tools such as search engines, APIs, vector databases, etc., which can expand their baseline functionality. Command R7B excels at tool use, exhibiting particular strength in using tools in real-world, diverse, and dynamic environments. In addition, Command R7B is good at avoiding unnecessarily calling tools, which is an important aspect of tool-use in practical applications. 
- Agents - As this is being written, [agents](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multi-step-tool-use) are among the most exciting frontiers for large language models. Command R7B’s multistep tool use capabilities allow it to power fast and capable REACT agents. When set up as an internet-augmented research agent, for example, Command R7B ably completes tasks that require breaking down complex questions into subgoals, and also performs favorably in domains that utilize complex reasoning and active information seeking. 

Command R7B is available today on the Cohere Platform as well as accessible on HuggingFace, or you can access it in the SDK with `command-r7b-12-2024`. For more information, check out our [dedicated blog post](https://cohere.com/blog/command-r7b).

## Command R August 2024 Release
Cohere's flagship text-generation models, Command R and Command R+, received a substantial update in August 2024. We chose to designate these models with time stamps, so in the API Command R 08-2024 is accesible with `command-r-08-2024`.

With the release, both models include the following feature improvements:
- For tool use, Command R and Command R+ have demonstrated improved decision-making around whether or not to use a tool.
- The updated models are better able to follow instructions included by the user in the preamble.
- Better structured data analysis for structured data manipulation. 
- Improved robustness to non-semantic prompt changes like white space or new lines.
- Models will decline unanswerable questions and are now able to execute RAG workflows without citations

`command-r-08-2024` delivers around 50% higher throughput and 20% lower latencies as compared to the previous Command R version, while cutting the hardware footprint required to serve the model by half. Read more in the relevant blog post.

What's more, both these updated models can now operate in one of several safety modes, which gives developers more granular control over how models generate output in a variety of different contexts. Find more in these [safety modes docs](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/safety-modes).


## Unique Command R Model Capabilities

Command R has been trained on a massive corpus of diverse texts in multiple languages, and can perform a wide array of text-generation tasks. Moreover, Command R has been trained with a particular focus on excelling in some of the most critical business use-cases.

### Multilingual Capabilities

We want Command R to serve as many people, organizations, and markets as possible, so the new Command R is capable of interacting in many languages to a fairly high degree of accuracy.

The model is optimized to perform well in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Arabic. 

Additionally, pre-training data has been included for the following 13 languages: Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, Persian.

The model has been trained to respond in the language of the user. Here's an example:

```python PYTHON
import cohere
co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

res = co.chat(
  model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
  messages=[
        {
            "role" : "user",
            "content" : "Écris une description de produit pour une voiture électrique en 50 à 75 mots"
        }
  ]
)

print(res)
```

And here's what the response might look like:

```text TEXT
Découvrez la voiture électrique qui va révolutionner votre façon de conduire.
Avec son design élégant, cette voiture offre une expérience de conduite unique
avec une accélération puissante et une autonomie impressionnante. Sa
technologie avancée vous garantit une charge rapide et une fiabilité inégalée.
Avec sa conception innovante et durable, cette voiture est parfaite pour les 
trajets urbains et les longues distances. Profitez d'une conduite silencieuse
et vivez l'expérience de la voiture électrique!
```

Command R can not only be used to generate text in several languages but can also perform cross-lingual tasks such as translation or answering questions about content in other languages.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation

Command R has been trained with the ability to ground its generations. This means that it can generate responses based on a list of supplied document snippets, and it will include citations in its response indicating the source of the information.

For more information, check out our dedicated guide on [retrieval augmented generation](/v2/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag).

### Tool Use

Command R has been trained with conversational tool use capabilities. This functionality takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-system preamble), along with a list of available tools. The model will then generate a json-formatted list of actions to execute on a subset of those tools. For more information, check out our dedicated [tool use](/v2/docs/tool-use) guide.
