<Note title="Note"> 
The code examples in this section use the Cohere v1 API. The v2 API is not yet supported for cloud deployments and will be coming soon.
</Note>

In an effort to make our language-model capabilities more widely available, we've partnered with a few major platforms to create hosted versions of our offerings. 

In this article, you learn how to use [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/) to deploy both the Cohere Command models and the Cohere Embed models on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform.

The following six models are available through Azure AI Studio with pay-as-you-go, token-based billing:

- Command R (and the [refreshed Command R model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r#:~:text=Command%20R%20August%202024%20Release))
- Command R+ (and the [refreshed Command R+ model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus#:~:text=Command%20R%2B%20August%202024%20Release))
- Embed v3 - English
- Embed v3 - Multilingual
- Cohere Rerank V3 (English)
- Cohere Rerank V3 (multilingual)

## Prerequisites

Whether you're using Command or Embed, the initial set up is the same. You'll need:

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [Azure AI hub resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource). Note: for Cohere models, the pay-as-you-go deployment offering is only available with AI hubs created in the `EastUS`, `EastUS2` or `Sweden Central` regions.
- An [Azure AI project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects) in Azure AI Studio.
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Studio. To perform the required steps, your user account must be assigned the Azure AI Developer role on the resource group. For more information on permissions, see [Role-based access control in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/rbac-ai-studio).

For workflows based around Command, Embed, or Rerank, you'll also need to create a deployment and consume the model. Here are links for more information:

- **Command:** [create a Command deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command#create-a-new-deployment) and then [consume the Command model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command#create-a-new-deployment).
- **Embed:** [create an Embed deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-embed#create-a-new-deployment) and [consume the Embed model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-embed#consume-the-cohere-embed-models-as-a-service).
- **Rerank**: [create a Rerank deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-rerank) and [consume the Rerank model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-rerank#consume-the-cohere-rerank-models-as-a-service).

## Text Generation

We expose two routes for Command R and Command R+ inference:

- `v1/chat/completions` adheres to the Azure AI Generative Messages API schema; 
- ` v1/chat` supports Cohere's native API schema.

You can find more information about Azure's API [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command#chat-api-reference-for-cohere-models-deployed-as-a-service).

Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to programmatically interact with a Cohere model on Azure:

```python PYTHON
import urllib.request
import json

# Configure payload data sending to API endpoint
data = {
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is good about Wuhan?"},
    ],
    "max_tokens": 500,
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "stream": "True",
}

body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))

# Replace the url with your API endpoint
url = (
    "https://your-endpoint.inference.ai.azure.com/v1/chat/completions"
)

# Replace this with the key for the endpoint
api_key = "your-auth-key"
if not api_key:
    raise Exception("API Key is missing")

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": (api_key),
}

req = urllib.request.Request(url, body, headers)

try:
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
    result = response.read()
    print(result)
except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
    print("The request failed with status code: " + str(error.code))
    # Print the headers - they include the requert ID and the timestamp, which are useful for debugging the failure
    print(error.info())
    print(error.read().decode("utf8", "ignore"))
```

You can find more code snippets, including examples of how to stream responses, in this [notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/foundation-models/cohere/webrequests.ipynb).

Though this section is called "Text Generation", it's worth pointing out that these models are capable of much more. Specifically, you can use Azure-hosted Cohere models for both retrieval augmented generation and [multi-step tool use](/docs/multi-step-tool-use). Check the linked pages for much more information.

Finally, we released refreshed versions of Command R and Command R+ in August 2024, both of which are now available on Azure. Check [these Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command?tabs=cohere-command-r-08-2024&pivots=programming-language-python#:~:text=the%20model%20catalog.-,Cohere%20Command%20chat%20models,-The%20Cohere%20Command) for more information (select the Cohere Command R 08-2024 or Cohere Command R+ 08-2024 tabs).

## Embeddings

We expose two routes for Embed v3 - English and Embed v3 - Multilingual inference:

- `v1/embeddings` adheres to the Azure AI Generative Messages API schema; 
- ` v1/embed` supports Cohere's native API schema.

You can find more information about Azure's API [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-embed#embed-api-reference-for-cohere-embed-models-deployed-as-a-service).

```python PYTHON
import urllib.request
import json

# Configure payload data sending to API endpoint
data = {"input": ["hi"]}

body = str.encode(json.dumps(data))

# Replace the url with your API endpoint
url = "https://your-endpoint.inference.ai.azure.com/v1/embedding"

# Replace this with the key for the endpoint
api_key = "your-auth-key"
if not api_key:
    raise Exception("API Key is missing")

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": (api_key),
}

req = urllib.request.Request(url, body, headers)

try:
    response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
    result = response.read()
    print(result)
except urllib.error.HTTPError as error:
    print("The request failed with status code: " + str(error.code))
    # Print the headers - they include the requert ID and the timestamp, which are useful for debugging the failure
    print(error.info())
    print(error.read().decode("utf8", "ignore"))
```

## ReRank

We currently exposes the `v1/rerank` endpoint for inference with both Rerank 3 - English and Rerank 3 - Multilingual. For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-rerank#rerank-api-reference-for-cohere-rerank-models-deployed-as-a-service) section. 

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.Client(
    base_url="https://<endpoint>.<region>.inference.ai.azure.com/v1",
    api_key="<key>",
)

documents = [
    {
        "Title": "Incorrect Password",
        "Content": "Hello, I have been trying to access my account for the past hour and it keeps saying my password is incorrect. Can you please help me?",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Confirmation Email Missed",
        "Content": "Hi, I recently purchased a product from your website but I never received a confirmation email. Can you please look into this for me?",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Questions about Return Policy",
        "Content": "Hello, I have a question about the return policy for this product. I purchased it a few weeks ago and it is defective.",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Customer Support is Busy",
        "Content": "Good morning, I have been trying to reach your customer support team for the past week but I keep getting a busy signal. Can you please help me?",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Received Wrong Item",
        "Content": "Hi, I have a question about my recent order. I received the wrong item and I need to return it.",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Customer Service is Unavailable",
        "Content": "Hello, I have been trying to reach your customer support team for the past hour but I keep getting a busy signal. Can you please help me?",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Return Policy for Defective Product",
        "Content": "Hi, I have a question about the return policy for this product. I purchased it a few weeks ago and it is defective.",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Wrong Item Received",
        "Content": "Good morning, I have a question about my recent order. I received the wrong item and I need to return it.",
    },
    {
        "Title": "Return Defective Product",
        "Content": "Hello, I have a question about the return policy for this product. I purchased it a few weeks ago and it is defective.",
    },
]

response = co.rerank(
    documents=documents,
    query="What emails have been about returning items?",
    rank_fields=["Title", "Content"],
    top_n=5,
)
```

## Using the Cohere SDK

You can use the Cohere SDK client to consume Cohere models that are deployed via Azure AI Foundry. This means you can leverage the SDK's features such as RAG, tool use, structured outputs, and more.

The following are a few examples on how to use the SDK for the different models.

### Setup
```python PYTHON
# pip install cohere

import cohere

# For Command models
co_chat = cohere.Client(
    api_key="AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL",
    base_url="AZURE_MODEL_ENDPOINT",  # Example - https://Cohere-command-r-plus-08-2024-xyz.eastus.models.ai.azure.com/
)

# For Embed models
co_embed = cohere.Client(
    api_key="AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL",
    base_url="AZURE_MODEL_ENDPOINT",  # Example - https://cohere-embed-v3-multilingual-xyz.eastus.models.ai.azure.com/
)

# For Rerank models
co_rerank = cohere.Client(
    api_key="AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL",
    base_url="AZURE_MODEL_ENDPOINT",  # Example - https://cohere-rerank-v3-multilingual-xyz.eastus.models.ai.azure.com/
)
```

### Chat
```python PYTHON
message = "I'm joining a new startup called Co1t today. Could you help me write a short introduction message to my teammates."

response = co_chat.chat(message=message)

print(response)
```
### RAG
```python PYTHON
faqs_short = [
    {
        "text": "Reimbursing Travel Expenses: Easily manage your travel expenses by submitting them through our finance tool. Approvals are prompt and straightforward."
    },
    {
        "text": "Health and Wellness Benefits: We care about your well-being and offer gym memberships, on-site yoga classes, and comprehensive health insurance."
    },
]

query = "Are there fitness-related perks?"

response = co_chat.chat(message=query, documents=faqs_short)

print(response)
```

### Embed
```python PYTHON
docs = [
    "Joining Slack Channels: You will receive an invite via email. Be sure to join relevant channels to stay informed and engaged.",
    "Finding Coffee Spots: For your caffeine fix, head to the break room's coffee machine or cross the street to the café for artisan coffee.",
]

doc_emb = co_embed.embed(
    input_type="search_document",
    texts=docs,
).embeddings
```

### Rerank
```python PYTHON
faqs_short = [
    {
        "text": "Reimbursing Travel Expenses: Easily manage your travel expenses by submitting them through our finance tool. Approvals are prompt and straightforward."
    },
    {
        "text": "Working from Abroad: Working remotely from another country is possible. Simply coordinate with your manager and ensure your availability during core hours."
    },
    {
        "text": "Health and Wellness Benefits: We care about your well-being and offer gym memberships, on-site yoga classes, and comprehensive health insurance."
    },
]

query = "Are there fitness-related perks?"

results = co_rerank.rerank(
    query=query,
    documents=faqs_short,
    top_n=2,
    model="rerank-english-v3.0",
)
```

Here are some other examples for [Command](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/foundation-models/cohere/cohere-cmdR.ipynb) and [Embed](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/foundation-models/cohere/cohere-embed.ipynb). 

The important thing to understand is that our new and existing customers can call the models from Azure while still leveraging their integration with the Cohere SDK.
