You can use Cohere's SDK to access Cohere's models on private deployments.

## Installation

To install the Cohere SDK, choose from the following 4 languages:

--todo - from snippets library--

## Getting Started

The only difference between using Cohere's models on private deployments and the Cohere platform is how you set up the client:
- `api_key` - Pass a blank value
- `base_url` - Pass the URL of your private deployment

--todo - from snippets library - all 4 languages--

To get started with example use cases, refer to the following quickstart examples:
