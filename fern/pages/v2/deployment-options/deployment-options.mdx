Cohere's models are available on the following platforms:

- Cohere Platform
- Private Deployments
  - Cloud
  - On-Premises
- Cloud AI Platforms
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    - Amazon SageMaker
    - Amazon Bedrock
  - Microsoft Azure
    - Azure AI Foundry
  - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
    - OCI Generative AI Service

## Cohere Platform

This is the fastest and easiest way to start using Cohere’s models. The models are hosted on Cohere infrastructure and available on our public SaaS platform (which provides an API data opt-out), which is fully managed by Cohere.

## Private Deployments

Private deployments (cloud) allow enterprises to deploy Cohere's models privately on cloud platforms on on-premises. This allows enterprises to maintain a high level of security and control over sensitive information.

You will need a license and image tag provided by Cohere in order to proceed with private deployments. To get this [contact sales here.](https://cohere.com/contact-sales). [See here for more details](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/single-container-on-private-clouds) on how to use Cohere with your own infrastructure.

## Cloud AI Platforms

These managed services enable enterprises to access Cohere’s models on cloud AI platforms. In this scenario, Cohere’s models are hosted on the cloud provider’s infrastructure. Cohere is cloud-agnostic, meaning you can deploy our models through any cloud provider. Examples include Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, OCI Generative AI, and Azure AI.

### AWS

Developers can access a range of Cohere’s language models in a private environment via Amazon’s AWS Cloud platform. Cohere’s models are supported on two Amazon services: **Amazon SageMaker** and **Amazon Bedrock**.

#### Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is a service that allows customers to prepare data and build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. [Read about SageMaker here.](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/)

Cohere offers a comprehensive suite of generative and embedding models through SageMaker on a range of hardware options, many of which support finetuning for deeper customization and performance.

[View Cohere's model listing on the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=87af0c85-6cf9-4ed8-bee0-b40ce65167e0).

#### Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service where foundational models from Cohere are made available through a single, serverless API. [Read about Bedrock here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock).

### OCI

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Generative AI is a fully managed service that enables you to use Cohere's [generative](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/generate-models.htm) and [embedding models](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/embed-models.htm) through an API.
