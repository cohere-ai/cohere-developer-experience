## Prerequisites

To get started, follow the steps outlined on the [Bedrock page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/setting-up.html), and in particular, be sure to do the following:

- [Sign up for an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#sign-up-for-aws)
- [Create an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#create-an-admin)
- [Grant programmatic access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#grant-program-access)
- [Get console and playground access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#setting-up-console)
- [Add model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)

Finally, install the Cohere SDK:

```bash
pip install -U cohere
```

## Text Generation

You can use this code to invoke either Command R (`cohere.command-r-v1:0`), Command R+ (`cohere.command-r-plus-v1:0`) on Amazon Bedrock:

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.BedrockClient(
    aws_region="us-east-1",  # pick a region where the model is available
    aws_access_key="...",
    aws_secret_key="...",
    aws_session_token="...",
)

result = co.chat(message="Write a LinkedIn post about starting a career in tech:",
                 model='cohere.command-r-plus-v1:0' # or 'cohere.command-r-v1:0'
                 )

print(result)
```

## Embeddings

You can use this code to invoke Cohere's Embed English v3 model (`cohere.embed-english-v3`) or Embed Multilingual v3 model (`cohere.embed-multilingual-v3`) on Amazon Bedrock: 

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.BedrockClient(
    aws_region="us-east-1",  # pick a region where the model is available
    aws_access_key="...",
    aws_secret_key="...",
    aws_session_token="...",
)

# Input parameters for embed. In this example we are embedding hacker news post titles.
texts = ["Interesting (Non software) books?",
         "Non-tech books that have helped you grow professionally?",
         "I sold my company last month for $5m. What do I do with the money?",
         "How are you getting through (and back from) burning out?",
         "I made $24k over the last month. Now what?",
         "What kind of personal financial investment do you do?",
         "Should I quit the field of software development?"]
input_type = "clustering"
model_id = "cohere.embed-english-v3" # or "cohere.embed-multilingual-v3"


# Invoke the model and print the response
result = co.embed(
	model=model_id,
	input_type=input_type,
	texts=texts
)

print(result)
```

## Rerank

You can use this code to invoke our latest Rerank models on Amazon Bedrock:

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.BedrockClientV2(
    aws_region="us-west-2", # pick a region where the model is available
    aws_access_key="...",
    aws_secret_key="...",
    aws_session_token="...",
)

docs = [
    "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
    "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
    "Capitalization or capitalisation in English grammar is the use of a capital letter at the start of a word. English usage varies from capitalization in other languages.",
    "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
    "Capital punishment has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states.",
]

response = co.rerank(
    model="cohere.rerank-v3-5:0",
    query="What is the capital of the United States?",
    documents=docs,
    top_n=3,
)

print(response)
```
