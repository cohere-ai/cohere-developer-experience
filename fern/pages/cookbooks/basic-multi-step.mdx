Tool use allows developers to connect Cohere's models to external tools like search engines, APIs, functions, databases, etc.

Multi-step tool use is an extension of this basic idea, and allows the model to call more than one tool in a sequence of steps, using the results from one tool call in a subsequent step. This process allows the language model to reason, perform dynamic actions, and quickly adapt on the basis of information coming from external sources.

The recommended way to achieve [multi-step tool use with Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multi-step-tool-use) is by leveraging the [Langchain framework](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/cohere#react-agent) in Python.

```python PYTHON
import os
os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'] = <your-api-key>
```

## Define tools

Your agent will be equipped with the following tools. The model can pick between

- doing a search on the web
- and/or retrieving data from a vector store
- and/or using a python interpreter
- and/or directly answering [ this tool comes out of the box! ]

Plus the model can self-reflect.

#### Web search

You can easily equip your agent with web search!

```python PYTHON
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = <your-api-key> # you can create an API key for free on Tavily's website

internet_search = TavilySearchResults()
internet_search.name = "internet_search"
internet_search.description = "Returns a list of relevant document snippets for a textual query retrieved from the internet."


from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class TavilySearchInput(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(description="Query to search the internet with")
internet_search.args_schema = TavilySearchInput
```

#### Vector store

You can easily equip your agent with a vector store!

```python PYTHON
!pip --quiet install faiss-cpu tiktoken
```

```txt title="Output"

[?25h
```

```python PYTHON
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_cohere import CohereEmbeddings

embd = CohereEmbeddings()

urls = [
    "https://paulgraham.com/best.html",
]

docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]
docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=0
)
doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(
    documents=doc_splits,
    embedding=embd,
)

vectorstore_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

```

```python PYTHON
from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool

vectorstore_search = create_retriever_tool(
    retriever=vectorstore_retriever,
    name="vectorstore_search",
    description="Retrieve relevant info from a vectorstore that contains information from Paul Graham about how to write good essays."
)
```

#### Python interpreter tool

You can easily equip your agent with a python interpreter!

```python PYTHON
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL

python_repl = PythonREPL()
python_tool = Tool(
    name="python_repl",
    description="Executes python code and returns the result. The code runs in a static sandbox without interactive mode, so print output or save output to a file.",
    func=python_repl.run,
)
python_tool.name = "python_interpreter"

class ToolInput(BaseModel):
    code: str = Field(description="Python code to execute.")
python_tool.args_schema = ToolInput
```

#### Transform any Python function in a Tool

You can easily equip your agent with any Python function!

```python PYTHON
from langchain_core.tools import tool
import random

@tool
def random_operation_tool(a: int, b: int):
  """Calculates a random operation between the inputs."""
  coin_toss = random.uniform(0, 1)
  if coin_toss > 0.5:
    return {'output': a*b}
  else:
    return {'output': a+b}

random_operation_tool.name = "random_operation" # use python case
random_operation_tool.description = "Calculates a random operation between the inputs."

from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class random_operation_inputs(BaseModel):
    a: int = Field(description="First input")
    b: int = Field(description="Second input")
random_operation_tool.args_schema = random_operation_inputs
```

## Create ReAct Agent

The model can smartly pick the right tool(s) for the user query, call them in any sequence, analyze the results and self-reflect.
Once the model considers it has enough information to answer the user question, it generates the final answer.

```python PYTHON
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_cohere.react_multi_hop.agent import create_cohere_react_agent
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_cohere.chat_models import ChatCohere

llm = ChatCohere(model="command-r-plus", temperature=0.3)

preamble = """
You are an expert who answers the user's question with the most relevant datasource. You are equipped with an internet search tool and a special vectorstore of information about how to write good essays.
You also have a 'random_operation_tool' tool, you must use it to compute the random operation between two numbers.
"""


prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("{input}")

agent = create_cohere_react_agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=[internet_search, vectorstore_search, python_tool, random_operation_tool],
    prompt=prompt,
)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[internet_search, vectorstore_search, python_tool, random_operation_tool], verbose=True)
```

## Ask a standalone question to the ReAct agent

A question that requires using a predefined tool from Langchain

```python PYTHON
response = agent_executor.invoke({
    "input": "I want to write an essay about the Roman Empire. Any tips for writing an essay? Any fun facts?",
    "preamble": preamble,
})

response['output']

I will search for tips on writing an essay and fun facts about the Roman Empire.
{'tool_name': 'vectorstore_search', 'parameters': {'query': 'tips for writing an essay'}}
[0m[33;1m[1;3mbe? I should have asked how do you write essays well? Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer
to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay
writing. The second question forces it to be.Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do
you do that well? How do you discover by writing?An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a
question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't
have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like
one in the sense that it spurs some response.How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to
choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.
Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they
call an edge — a convincing story about why in some class of
trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't
attack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about
it or way of approaching it.You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind
of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about
something other people take for granted can be edge enough.If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could
be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an
important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed
insignificant at first. How can they all be finches?
[2]Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud
about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific
string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This
initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts
your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because
once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting
with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because
this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some
specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's
wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay
writing is rereading what you've written and asking is this correct

didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you
need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't
generate those systematically. If only.
[9]You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The
quality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes
in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning
about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell
people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy
books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the
topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps
that's actually optimal in this business.You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building
things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's
important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who
make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an
afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart
people. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y
Combinator consists of.While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes
from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have
to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,
I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have
done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other
fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your
time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was
hard.I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to
those already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working
on other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to
be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing
you'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the
questions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same
thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just
as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any

You don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's
no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep
rewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.
It's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting
as we speak.But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly
on effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the
difference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing
to get. That pool has no bottom.How to get more questions? That is the most important question of
all.Notes[1]
There might be some resistance to this conclusion on the
grounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by
a small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties
if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide
where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a
handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,
could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.Darwin's 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839.
Extracts from it were published in 1858.[2]
When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor
question, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to
pay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious
about something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed
it's less random than it seems.[3]
Corollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing
won't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the
ideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.[4]
Sometimes this process begins before you start writing.
Sometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want
to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide everything
they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they
start writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them
started — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the
spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less
your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.[5]
The problem with this type of "greedy" algorithm is that you

technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good
whole essays.At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels
like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every
answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you
start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,
you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just
as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's
not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be
asking the initial question of a new essay.That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:
the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough
starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though
if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by
burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of
essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You
can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees
end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually
it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously
at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an
example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that
the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the
best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be
worth investigating further.There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about
a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect
on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that
looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.
But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays
teach, and you can't teach people something they already know.
Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,
but an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that
it would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his
ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.
[10]I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay
would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would[0m[32;1m[1;3m
