    Shortens `text` by extracting key units of text from `text` based on their centrality and concatenating them.
    The output is the concatenation of those key units, in their original order. Centrality is graph-theoretic
    measure of connectedness of a node; the more connected a node is to surrounding nodes (and the more sparsely
    those neighbours are connected), the higher centrality.

    Key passages are identified via clustering in a three-step process:
    1. Break up `long` into chunks (either sentences or passages, based on `unit`)
    2. Embed each chunk using Cohere's embedding model and construct a similarity matrix
    3. Compute the centrality of each chunk
    4. Keep the highest-centrality chunks until `max_tokens` is reached
    5. Put together shorterned text by reordering chunks in their original order

    This approach is based on summarise.long_doc_summarization.extraction::extract_single_doc with sorting by
    centrality. Adapted here because installing the `summarise` repo would have added a lot of unused functionalities
    and dependencies.

## 2. Out-of-the-box summarization with Command-R [#out-of-the-box-summarization-with-command-r]

First, let's see Command-R's out-of-the-box performance. It's a 128k-context model, so we can pass the full IMF report in a single call. We replicate the exact instructions from the original tweet (correcting for a minor typo) for enabling fair comparisons.

```python PYTHON
prompt_template = """\
## text
{text}

## instructions
Step 1. Read the entire text from the first to the last page.
Step 2. Create a summary of every chapter from the first to the last page.

## summary
"""

prompt = prompt_template.format(text=text)
resp = co.chat(
  message=prompt,
  model=co_model,
  temperature=0.3,
  return_prompt=True
)

num_tokens_in = co.tokenize(resp.prompt).length
num_tokens_out = resp.meta["billed_units"]["output_tokens"]
print(f"Generated summary with {num_tokens_in} tokens in, {num_tokens_out} tokens out")
print()
print("--- Out-of-the-box summary with Command-R ---")
print()
print(resp.text)

```

# 3. Introduce citations to the summary for grounding [#introduce-citations-to-the-summary-for-grounding]

When summarizing long documents, introducing citations is one simple method for checking the factuality of the summary without needing to read the full document.

We've trained Command-R to introduce citations whenever prompted by our grounded generations instructions. Triggering this grounded mode is straightforward. Starting from the previous snippet, we only need to make two changes:

1. Pass our text to the `documents` argument
2. Pass our instructions to the `message` argument

For more information on how to enable grounded generation via our `co.chat` API, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat).

Finally, note that we chunk the IMF report into multiple documents before passing them to `co.chat`. This isn't necessary (`co.chat` annotates citations at the character level), but allows for more human-readable citations.

```python PYTHON
summarize_preamble = """\
You will receive a series of text fragments from an article that are presented in chronological order. \
As the assistant, you must generate responses to user's requests based on the information given in the fragments. \
Ensure that your responses are accurate and truthful, and that you reference your sources where appropriate to answer \
the queries, regardless of their complexity.\
"""

instructions = """\
## instructions
Step 1. Read the entire text from the first to the last page.
Step 2. Create a summary of every chapter from the first to the last page.
"""

chunked = build_simple_chunks(text, n_sentences=30)
resp = co.chat(
  preamble=summarize_preamble,
  message=instructions,
  documents=[{"text": chunk} for chunk in chunked],
  model=co_model,
  temperature=0.3,
  return_prompt=True
)

num_tokens_in = co.tokenize(resp.prompt).length
num_tokens_out = resp.meta["billed_units"]["output_tokens"]
print(f"Generated summary with {num_tokens_in} tokens in, {num_tokens_out} tokens out")
print()
print("--- Summary with citations using grounded generation in Command-R ---")
print()
print(resp.text)

```

Let's display the citations inside our answer:

```python PYTHON
print(insert_citations(resp.text, resp.citations))
```

We can now visualise which section of the answer is based on which passage in the main text. Verifying factuality is straightforward: pick a section and verify that the relevant information is contained in the cited chunk.

For instance, let's verify the statement

```
Around 40% of employment worldwide is exposed to AI [1, 6]
```

by checking its chunk:

```python PYTHON
print(chunked[6])
```

Seems convincing!
By repeating such checks, it's straightforward to build trust in your summaries.

# 4. Reduce the cost of summarization calls [#reduce-the-cost-of-summarization-calls]

Even though Command-R is an efficient, light-weight model, for some applications we may accept trading off some summarization quality for lower costs. To do this, we must reduce the amount of tokens sent to the model -- but how do we select the most relevant bits?

We have a whole notebook dedicated to methods for reducing context length. Here, we call our 'text-rank' method to select maximally central chunks in a graph based on the chunk-to-chunk similarties. For more detail, please refer [to this cookbook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zxSAbruOWwWJHNsj3N56uxZtUeiS7Evd).

```python PYTHON
num_tokens = 8192
shortened = textrank(text, co, num_tokens, n_sentences_per_passage=30)

chunked = build_simple_chunks(shortened)
resp = co.chat(
  message=instructions,
  documents=[{"text": chunk} for chunk in chunked],
  model=co_model,
  temperature=0.3,
  return_prompt=True
)

num_tokens_in = co.tokenize(resp.prompt).length
num_tokens_out = resp.meta["billed_units"]["output_tokens"]
print(f"Generated summary with {num_tokens_in} tokens in, {num_tokens_out} tokens out")
print()
print("--- Summary with citations using text-rank + grounding in Command-R ---")
print()
print(resp.text)

```

The summary is looking convincing! In practice, the trade-off between cost-efficiency and performance should be considered carefully.
