In the past months, we engineered a novel relevance endpoint that takes a query and a list of documents and predicts the relevance between the query and each document.

It can be used in a two-stage retrieval setup: First you take the user question, and retrieve the top-100 documents from your collection by either using lexical search or semantic search.

You then pass the question and these top-100 documents to our relevance-endpoint to get a score for each document. You can then rank these documents based on these scores.

In our benchmarks across 20 datasets, we **saw significant improvements compared to lexical and semantic search**, especially for use-cases where no training data is available.

We will demonstrate the rerank endpoint in this notebook.

## Using the Endpoint

In the following cell we will call rerank to rank `docs` based on how relevant they are with `query`.

```python PYTHON
results = co.rerank(query=query, model=MODEL_NAME, documents=docs, top_n=3) # Change top_n to change the number of results returned. If top_n is not passed, all results will be returned.
for idx, r in enumerate(results):
  print(f"Document Rank: {idx + 1}, Document Index: {r.index}")
  print(f"Document: {r.document['text']}")
  print(f"Relevance Score: {r.relevance_score:.2f}")
  print("\n")
```

```txt OUTPUT
Document Rank: 1, Document Index: 3
Document: Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district. The President of the USA and many major national government offices are in the territory. This makes it the political center of the United States of America.
Relevance Score: 1.00


Document Rank: 2, Document Index: 5
Document: Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since before the United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states. The federal government (including the United States military) also uses capital punishment.

## Search on Wikipedia - End2end demo

The following is an example how to use this model end-to-end to search over the Simple English Wikipedia, which consists of about 500k passages.

We use BM25 lexical search to retrieve the top-100 passages matching the query and then send these 100 passages and the query to our rerank endpoint to get a re-ranked list. We output the top-3 hits according to BM25 lexical search (as used by e.g. Elasticsearch) and the re-ranked list from our endpoint.

```python PYTHON

    Ted Cassidy (July 31, 1932 - January 16, 1979) was an American actor. He was best known for his roles as Lurch and Thing on "The Addams Family". Aileen Carol Wuornos Pralle (born Aileen Carol Pittman; February 29, 1956 – October 9, 2002) was an American serial killer. She was born in Rochester, Michigan. She confessed to killing six men in Florida and was executed in Florida State Prison by lethal injection for the murders. Wuornos said that the men she killed had raped her or tried to rape her while she was working as a prostitute.

Input question: When is Chinese New Year
Top-3 lexical search (BM25) hits
    18.606	Today in China the Gregorian calendar is used for most activities. At the same time, the Chinese calendar is still used for traditional Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year.
    18.151	Before that, the holiday was usually just called the "NewYear". Because the traditional Chinese calendar is mostly based on the changes in the moon, the Chinese New Year is also known in English as the "Lunar New Year" or "Chinese Lunar New Year". This name comes from "Luna", an old Latin name for the moon. The Indonesian name for the holiday is Imlek, which comes from the Hokkien word for the old Chinese calendar and is therefore also like saying "Lunar New Year".
    18.011	Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year.

    0.999	Chinese New Year, known in China as the SpringFestival and in Singapore as the LunarNewYear, is a holiday on and around the new moon on the first day of the year in the traditional Chinese calendar. This calendar is based on the changes in the moon and is only sometimes changed to fit the seasons of the year based on how the Earth moves around the sun. Because of this, Chinese New Year is never on January1. It moves around between January21 and February20.
    0.997	Chinese New Year always starts on a new moon, when the Moon is between the Earth and Sun and it looks all dark in the night sky. Because new moons happen about every 29.53 days but the year set by Pope GregoryXIII is 365.2425 days long, the Chinese holiday moves to different days each year. The Chinese calendar adds a 13th month every so often to keep the seasons in the right place, so the first day of the new year always happens between January21 and February20 on the 2nd or 3rd new moon after the 1st day of winter. The chart on the right gives the day of each Chinese New Year from 1996 to 2031.
    0.996	Chinese New Year lasts fifteen days, including one week as a national holiday. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. It is always in the middle of winter, but is called the Spring Festival in Chinese because Chinese seasons are a little different from English ones. On the first day of the Chinese New Year, people call on friends and relatives. Because most people watch the special performances on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Chinese New Year is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:财神爷), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:饺子. Pinyin: Jaozi). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck. The last day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:汤圆,元宵), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.
