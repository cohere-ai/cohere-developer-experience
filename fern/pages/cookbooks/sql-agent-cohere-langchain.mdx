This tutorial demonstrates how to create a SQL agent using Cohere and LangChain. The agent can translate natural language queries coming from users into SQL, and execute them against a database. This powerful combination allows for intuitive interaction with databases without requiring direct SQL knowledge.

Key topics covered:
1. Setting up the necessary libraries and environment
2. Connecting to a SQLite database
3. Configuring the LangChain SQL Toolkit
4. Creating a custom prompt template with few-shot examples
5. Building and running the SQL agent

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a functional SQL agent that can answer questions about your data using natural language.


This tutorial uses a mocked up data of a manufacturing environment where a product item's production is tracked across multiple stations, allowing for analysis of production efficiency, station performance, and individual item progress through the manufacturing process. This is modelled after a real customer use case.

The database contains two tables:
- The `product_tracking` table records the movement of items through different zones in manufacturing stations, including start and end times, station names, and product IDs.
- The `status` table logs the operational status of stations, including timestamps, station names, and whether they are productive or in downtime.

## <a id='toc1_1_'></a>[Import the required libraries](#toc0_)

First, let's import the necessary libraries for creating a SQL agent using Cohere and LangChain. These libraries enable natural language interaction with databases and provide tools for building AI-powered agents.


```python PYTHON
import os

os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = ""
```


```python PYTHON
! pip install faiss-gpu -qq
```


```python PYTHON
! pip install langchain-core langchain-cohere langchain-community
```

```python PYTHON
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_cohere import create_sql_agent
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_cohere.chat_models import ChatCohere
from langchain_community.utilities.sql_database import SQLDatabase
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_core.example_selectors import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain_cohere import CohereEmbeddings
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import os
import json
```


## <a id='toc1_2_'></a>[Load the database](#toc0_)

Next, we load the database for our manufacturing data.

We create an in-memory SQLite database using SQL scripts for the `product_tracking` and `status` tables. You can get the [SQL tables here](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/agents/i-5O-sql-agent).

We then create a SQLDatabase instance, which will be used by our LangChain tools and agents to interact with the data.


```python PYTHON
import sqlite3
import os

from langchain_community.utilities.sql_database import SQLDatabase
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool

def get_engine_for_manufacturing_db():
    """Create an in-memory database with the manufacturing data tables."""
    connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:", check_same_thread=False)

    # Read and execute the SQL scripts
    for sql_file in ['product_tracking.sql', 'status.sql']:
        with open(sql_file, 'r') as file:
            sql_script = file.read()
            connection.executescript(sql_script)

    return create_engine(
        "sqlite://",
        creator=lambda: connection,
        poolclass=StaticPool,
        connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
    )

# Create the engine
engine = get_engine_for_manufacturing_db()

# Create the SQLDatabase instance
db = SQLDatabase(engine)

# Now you can use this db instance with your LangChain tools and agents
```


```python PYTHON
# Test the connection
db.run("SELECT * FROM status LIMIT 5;")
```

```
"[('2024-05-09 19:28:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-05-09', '19', '28', 'stn3', 'downtime'), ('2024-04-21 06:57:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-21', '6', '57', 'stn3', 'productive'), ('2024-04-11 23:52:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-11', '23', '52', 'stn4', 'productive'), ('2024-04-03 21:52:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-03', '21', '52', 'stn2', 'downtime'), ('2024-04-30 05:01:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-30', '5', '1', 'stn4', 'productive')]"
```



```python PYTHON
# Test the connection
db.run("SELECT * FROM product_tracking LIMIT 5;")
```

```
"[('2024-05-27 17:22:00', '2024-05-27 17:57:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-05-27', '17', 'stn2', 'wip', '187', '35'), ('2024-04-26 15:56:00', '2024-04-26 17:56:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-26', '15', 'stn4', 'wip', '299', '120'), ('2024-04-12 04:36:00', '2024-04-12 05:12:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-12', '4', 'stn3', 'wip', '60', '36'), ('2024-04-19 15:15:00', '2024-04-19 15:22:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-19', '15', 'stn4', 'wait', '227', '7'), ('2024-04-24 19:10:00', '2024-04-24 21:07:00', 'Canada/Toronto', '2024-04-24', '19', 'stn4', 'wait', '169', '117')]"
```


## <a id='toc1_3_'></a>[Setup the LangChain SQL Toolkit](#toc0_)

Next, we initialize the LangChain SQL Toolkit and sets up the language model to use Cohere's model. This prepares the necessary components for querying the SQL database using natural language.



```python PYTHON
## Define model to use
import os

MODEL="command-r-plus-08-2024"
llm = ChatCohere(model=MODEL,
                 temperature=0.1,
                 verbose=True,
                 cohere_api_key=os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY"))


toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm)
context = toolkit.get_context()
tools = toolkit.get_tools()

print('**List of pre-defined Langchain Tools**')
print([tool.name for tool in tools])
```
```
**List of pre-defined Langchain Tools**
['sql_db_query', 'sql_db_schema', 'sql_db_list_tables', 'sql_db_query_checker']
```

## <a id='toc1_4_'></a>[Create a prompt template with few shot examples](#toc0_)

Next, we create a prompt template with few-shot examples. Few-shot examples are used to provide the model with context and improve its performance on specific tasks. In this case, we'll prepare examples of natural language queries and their corresponding SQL queries to help the model generate accurate SQL statements for our database.

In this example, we use `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` to select the top k examples that are most similar to an input query out of all the examples available.


```python PYTHON
examples = [
    {
        "input": "What was the average processing time for all stations on April 3rd 2024?",
        "query": "SELECT station_name, AVG(CAST(duration AS INTEGER)) AS avg_processing_time FROM product_tracking WHERE date = '2024-04-03' AND zone = 'wip' GROUP BY station_name ORDER BY station_name;",
    },
    {
        "input": "What was the average processing time for all stations on April 3rd 2024 between 4pm and 6pm?",
        "query": "SELECT station_name, AVG(CAST(duration AS INTEGER)) AS avg_processing_time FROM product_tracking WHERE date = '2024-04-03' AND CAST(hour AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 16 AND 18 AND zone = 'wip' GROUP BY station_name ORDER BY station_name;",
    },
    {
        "input": "What was the average processing time for stn4 on April 3rd 2024?",
        "query": "SELECT AVG(CAST(duration AS INTEGER)) AS avg_processing_time FROM product_tracking WHERE date = '2024-04-03' AND station_name = 'stn4' AND zone = 'wip';",
    },
    {
        "input": "How much downtime did stn2 have on April 3rd 2024?",
        "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) AS downtime_count FROM status WHERE date = '2024-04-03' AND station_name = 'stn2' AND station_status = 'downtime';",
    },
    {
        "input": "What were the productive time and downtime numbers for all stations on April 3rd 2024?",
        "query": "SELECT station_name, station_status, COUNT(*) as total_time FROM status WHERE date = '2024-04-03' GROUP BY station_name, station_status;",
    },
    {
        "input": "What was the bottleneck station on April 3rd 2024?",
        "query": "SELECT station_name, AVG(CAST(duration AS INTEGER)) AS avg_processing_time FROM product_tracking WHERE date = '2024-04-03' AND zone = 'wip' GROUP BY station_name ORDER BY avg_processing_time DESC LIMIT 1;",
    },
    {
        "input": "Which percentage of the time was stn5 down in the last week of May?",
        "query": "SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN station_status = 'downtime' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage_downtime FROM status WHERE station_name = 'stn5' AND date >= '2024-05-25' AND date <= '2024-05-31';",
    },
]
```


```python PYTHON

Human: What was the productive time for all stations today?
```

## <a id='toc1_5_'></a>[Create the agent](#toc0_)

Next, we create an instance of the SQL agent using the LangChain framework, specifically using `create_sql_agent`.

This agent will be capable of interpreting natural language queries, converting them into SQL queries, and executing them against our database. The agent uses the LLM we defined earlier, along with the SQL toolkit and the custom prompt we created.


```python PYTHON
agent = create_sql_agent(
   llm=llm,
   toolkit=toolkit,
   prompt=full_prompt,
   verbose=True
)
```

## <a id='toc1_6_'></a>[Run the agent](#toc0_)

Now, we can run the agent and test it with a few different queries.


```python PYTHON
# %%time
output=agent.invoke({
   "input": "What was the total downtime for each station during the month of May 2024?",
    "date": datetime.now()
})
print(output['output'])

# Answer: stn2: 1 minute(s), stn3: 2 minute(s)stn5: 4 minute(s)
```

## Conclusion
This tutorial demonstrated how to create a SQL agent using Cohere and LangChain. The agent can translate natural language queries coming from users into SQL, and execute them against a database. This powerful combination allows for intuitive interaction with databases without requiring direct SQL knowledge.
