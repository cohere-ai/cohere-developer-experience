## Motivation

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been a go-to use case that enterprises have been adopting with large language models (LLMs). Even though it works well in general, there are edge cases where this can fail. Most commonly, when the retrieved document mentions the query but actually refers to another document, the model will fail to generate the correct answer.

We propose an agentic RAG system that leverages tool use to continue to retrieve documents if correct ones were not retrieved at first try. This is ideal for use cases where accuracy is a top priority and latency is not. For example, lawyers trying to find the most accurate answer from their contracts are willing to wait a few more seconds to get the answer instead of getting wrong answers fast.

## Objective

This notebook, we will explore how we can build a simple agentic RAG using Cohere's native API. We have prepared a fake dataset to demonstrate the use case.
We ask three questions that require different depths of retrieval. We will see how the model answers the question between simple and agentic RAG.

## Disclaimer

One of the challenges in building a RAG system is that it has many moving pieces: vector database, type of embedding model, use of reranker, number of retrieved documents, chunking strategy, and more. These components can make debugging and evaluating RAG systems difficult. Since this notebook focuses on the concept of agentic RAG, it will simplify other parts of the RAG system. For example, we will only retrieve top 1 docuemnt to demonstrate what happens when retrieved document does not contain the answer needed.

## Result

| Type                   | Question                                                  | Simple Rag                                                                                                                                                                                       | Agentic Rag                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-stage retrieval | Is there a state level law for wearing helmets?           | There is currently no state law requiring the use of helmets when riding a bicycle. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use.                                                     | There is currently no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles. |
| Multi-stage retrieval  | I live in orting, do I need to wear a helmet with a bike? | In the state of Washington, there is no law requiring you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use, so it is worth checking your local laws. | Yes, you do need to wear a helmet with a bike in Orting if you are under 17.                                                 |

As you will see more below, the multi-stage retrieval is achieved by adding a new function `reference_extractor()` that extracts other references in the documents and updating the instruction so the agent continues to retrieve more documents.

```python PYTHON
import os
from pprint import pprint

import cohere
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
```

```python PYTHON
# versions
print('cohere version:', cohere.__version__)
```

```txt OUTPUT
cohere version: 5.5.1

## Setup

```python PYTHON
COHERE_API_KEY = os.environ.get("CO_API_KEY")
COHERE_MODEL = 'command-r-plus'
co = cohere.Client(api_key=COHERE_API_KEY)
```

## Data

We leveraged data from [Washington Department of Transportation](https://wsdot.wa.gov/travel/bicycling-walking/bicycling-washington/bicyclist-laws-safety) and modified to fit the need of this demo.

## Question 1 - single-stage retrieval

Here we are asking a question that can be answered easily with single-stage retrieval. Both regular and agentic RAG should be able to answer this question easily. Below is the comparsion of the response.

| Question                                        | Simple Rag                                                                                                                                   | Agentic Rag                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is there a state level law for wearing helmets? | There is currently no state law requiring the use of helmets when riding a bicycle. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use. | There is currently no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles. |

```python PYTHON
question1 = "Is there a state level law for wearing helmets?"
```

### Simple RAG

```python PYTHON
output = simple_rag(question1, db)
print(output)
```

```txt OUTPUT
top_matched_document 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\nBody: Curre...
Name: combined, dtype: object
There is currently no state law requiring the use of helmets when riding a bicycle. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use.
```

### Agentic RAG

```python PYTHON
preamble = """
You are an expert assistant that helps users answers question about legal documents and policies.
Use the provided documents to answer questions about an employee's specific situation.
"""

output = cohere_agent(question1, preamble, tools, verbose=True)
```

```txt OUTPUT

== tool results:
{'top_matched_document': 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\nBody: Curre...
Name: combined, dtype: object}
There is currently no state law requiring helmet use. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles.
```

## Question 2 - double-stage retrieval

The second question requires a double-stage retrieval because top matched document references another document. You will see below that the agentic RAG is unable to produce the correct answer initially. But when given proper tools and instructions, it finds the correct answer.

| Question                                                  | Simple Rag                                                                                                                                                                                       | Agentic Rag                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I live in orting, do I need to wear a helmet with a bike? | In the state of Washington, there is no law requiring you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use, so it is worth checking your local laws. | Yes, you do need to wear a helmet with a bike in Orting if you are under 17. |

```python PYTHON
question2 = "I live in orting, do I need to wear a helmet with a bike?"
```

### Simple RAG

```python PYTHON
output = simple_rag(question2, db)
print(output)
```

```txt OUTPUT
top_matched_document 1    Title: Bicycle helmet requirement\nBody: Curre...
Name: combined, dtype: object
In the state of Washington, there is no law requiring you to wear a helmet when riding a bike. However, some cities and counties do require helmet use, so it is worth checking your local laws.
```

### Agentic RAG

Produces same quality answer as the simple rag.

```python PYTHON
preamble = """

Use the provided documents to answer questions about an employee's specific situation.
"""

output = cohere_agent(question2, preamble, tools, verbose=True)
```

```txt OUTPUT

{'query': 'helmet with a bike'}
== tool results:

Name: combined, dtype: object}
There is no state law requiring helmet use, however, some cities and counties do require helmet use with bicycles. I cannot find any information about Orting specifically, but you should check with your local authority.
```

### Agentic RAG - New Tools

In order for the model to retrieve correct documents, we do two things:

1. New reference_extractor() function is added. This function finds the references to other documents when given query and documents.
2. We update the instruction that directs the agent to keep retrieving relevant documents.

```python PYTHON
def reference_extractor(query: str, documents: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Given a query and document, find references to other documents.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    # instruction
    Does the reference document mention any other documents? If so, list them.
    If not, return empty string.

    # user query
    {query}

    # retrieved documents
    {documents}
    """

    return co.chat(message=prompt, model=COHERE_MODEL, preamble=None).text


def retrieve_documents(query: str, n=1) -> dict:
    """

    query_emb = co.embed(
        texts=[query], model="embed-english-v3.0", input_type="search_query"
    )

    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(
        [query_emb.embeddings[0]], db.embeddings.tolist()
    )
    similarity_scores = similarity_scores[0]

    top_indices = similarity_scores.argsort()[::-1][:n]
    top_matches = db.iloc[top_indices]
    other_references = reference_extractor(query, top_matches.combined.tolist())

    return {
        "top_matched_document": top_matches.combined,
        "other_references_to_query": other_references,
    }


functions_map = {
    "retrieve_documents": retrieve_documents,
