Language models give computers the ability to search by meaning and go beyond searching by matching keywords. This capability is called semantic search.

In this notebook, we'll build a simple semantic search engine. The applications of semantic search go beyond building a web search engine. They can empower a private search engine for internal documents or records. It can also be used to power features like StackOverflow's "similar questions" feature.

1. Get the archive of questions
2. [Embed](https://docs.cohere.ai/embed-reference/) the archive
3. Search using an index and nearest neighbor search
4. Visualize the archive based on the embeddings

And if you're running an older version of the SDK, you might need to upgrade it like so:

```python
#!pip install --upgrade cohere
```

Get your Cohere API key by [signing up here](https://os.cohere.ai/register). Paste it in the cell below.

## 1. Getting Set Up

```python
#@title Import libraries (Run this cell to execute required code) {display-mode: "form"}

import cohere
import numpy as np
import re
import pandas as pd
from tqdm import tqdm
from datasets import load_dataset
import umap
import altair as alt
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
```

You'll need your API key for this next cell. [Sign up to Cohere](https://os.cohere.ai/) and get one if you haven't yet.

```python
model_name = "embed-english-v3.0"
api_key = ""
input_type_embed = "search_document"

co = cohere.Client(api_key)
```

## 2. Get The Archive of Questions

We'll use the [trec](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/trec) dataset which is made up of questions and their categories.

```python
dataset = load_dataset("trec", split="train")

df = pd.DataFrame(dataset)[:1000]

df.head(10)
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>label-coarse</th>
        <th>label-fine</th>
        <th>text</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>How did serfdom develop in and then leave Russia ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>What films featured the character Popeye Doyle ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>How can I find a list of celebrities ' real names ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>
          What fowl grabs the spotlight after the Chinese Year of the Monkey ?
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>What is the full form of .com ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>5</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>What contemptible scoundrel stole the cork from my lunch ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>6</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>What team did baseball 's St. Louis Browns become ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>7</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>What is the oldest profession ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>8</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>What are liver enzymes ?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>9</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Name the scar-faced bounty hunter of The Old West .</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## 2. Embed the archive

The next step is to embed the text of the questions.

<img
  alt="embedding archive texts"
  src="https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/images/semantic-search-embed-text-archive.png"
/>

To get a thousand embeddings of this length should take about fifteen seconds.

```python
embeds = co.embed(texts=list(df['text']),
                  model=model_name,
                  input_type=input_type_embed).embeddings
```

```python
embeds = np.array(embeds)
embeds.shape
```

```
(1000, 4096)
```

## 3. Search using an index and nearest neighbor search

<img
  alt="Building the search index from the embeddings"
  src="https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/images/semantic-search-index.png"
/>

Let's now use [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) to build an index that stores the embeddings in a way that is optimized for fast search. This approach scales well to a large number of texts (other options include [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann), and [PyNNDescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent)).

After building the index, we can use it to retrieve the nearest neighbors either of existing questions (section 3.1), or of new questions that we embed (section 3.2).

```python
search_index = AnnoyIndex(embeds.shape[1], 'angular')
for i in range(len(embeds)):
    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])

search_index.build(10) # 10 trees
search_index.save('test.ann')
```

```
True
```

### 3.1. Find the neighbors of an example from the dataset

If we're only interested in measuring the distance between the questions in the dataset (no outside queries), a simple way is to calculate the distance between every pair of embeddings we have.

```python
example_id = 92

similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_item(example_id,10,
                                                include_distances=True)
results = pd.DataFrame(data={'texts': df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]['text'],
                             'distance': similar_item_ids[1]}).drop(example_id)

print(f"Question:'{df.iloc[example_id]['text']}'\nNearest neighbors:")
results
```

```
Question:'What are bear and bull markets ?'
Nearest neighbors:
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>texts</th>
        <th>distance</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>614</th>
        <td>What animals do you find in the stock market ?</td>
        <td>0.904278</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>137</th>
        <td>What are equity securities ?</td>
        <td>0.992819</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>513</th>
        <td>What do economists do ?</td>
        <td>1.066583</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>307</th>
        <td>What does NASDAQ stand for ?</td>
        <td>1.080738</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>363</th>
        <td>What does it mean `` Rupee Depreciates '' ?</td>
        <td>1.086724</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>932</th>
        <td>Why did the world enter a global depression in 1929 ?</td>
        <td>1.099370</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>547</th>
        <td>Where can stocks be traded on-line ?</td>
        <td>1.105368</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>922</th>
        <td>What is the difference between a median and a mean ?</td>
        <td>1.141870</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>601</th>
        <td>What is `` the bear of beers '' ?</td>
        <td>1.154140</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### 3.2. Find the neighbors of a user query

We're not limited to searching using existing items. If we get a query, we can embed it and find its nearest neighbors from the dataset.

```python
query = "What is the tallest mountain in the world?"
input_type_query = "search_query"

query_embed = co.embed(texts=[query],
                  model=model_name,
                  input_type=input_type_query).embeddings

similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_vector(query_embed[0],10,
                                                include_distances=True)
query_results = pd.DataFrame(data={'texts': df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]['text'],
                             'distance': similar_item_ids[1]})


print(f"Query:'{query}'\nNearest neighbors:")
print(query_results) # NOTE: Your results might look slightly different to ours.
```

```
Query:'What is the tallest mountain in the world?'
Nearest neighbors:
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>texts</th>
        <th>distance</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>236</th>
        <td>What is the name of the tallest mountain in the world ?</td>
        <td>0.447309</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>670</th>
        <td>What is the highest mountain in the world ?</td>
        <td>0.552254</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>412</th>
        <td>
          What was the highest mountain on earth before Mount Everest was
          discovered ?
        </td>
        <td>0.801252</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>907</th>
        <td>
          What mountain range is traversed by the highest railroad in the world
          ?
        </td>
        <td>0.929516</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>435</th>
        <td>What is the highest peak in Africa ?</td>
        <td>0.930806</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>109</th>
        <td>Where is the highest point in Japan ?</td>
        <td>0.977315</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>901</th>
        <td>What 's the longest river in the world ?</td>
        <td>1.064209</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>114</th>
        <td>What is the largest snake in the world ?</td>
        <td>1.076390</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>962</th>
        <td>What 's the second-largest island in the world ?</td>
        <td>1.088034</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>27</th>
        <td>What is the highest waterfall in the United States ?</td>
        <td>1.091145</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## 4. Visualizing the archive

Finally, let's plot out all the questions onto a 2D chart so you're able to visualize the semantic similarities of this dataset!

```python
#@title Plot the archive {display-mode: "form"}

reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=20)
umap_embeds = reducer.fit_transform(embeds)
df_explore = pd.DataFrame(data={'text': df['text']})
df_explore['x'] = umap_embeds[:,0]
df_explore['y'] = umap_embeds[:,1]

chart = alt.Chart(df_explore).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x=#'x',
    alt.X('x',
        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)
    ),
    y=
    alt.Y('y',
        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)
    ),
    tooltip=['text']
).properties(
    width=700,
    height=400
)
chart.interactive()
```

Hover over the points to read the text. Do you see some of the patterns in clustered points? Similar questions, or questions asking about similar topics?

This concludes this introductory guide to semantic search using sentence embeddings. As you continue the path of building a search product additional considerations arise (like dealing with long texts, or finetuning to better improve the embeddings for a specific use case).
