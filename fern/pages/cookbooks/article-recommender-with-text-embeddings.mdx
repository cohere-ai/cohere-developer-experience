## Article Recommender with Text Embedding, Classification, and Extraction

This is a simple demonstration of how we can stack multiple NLP models together  
to get an output much closer to our desired outcome.

Embeddings can capture the meaning of a piece of text beyond keyword-matching. In this article, we will build a simple news article recommender system that computes the embeddings of all available articles and recommend the most relevant articles based on embeddings similarity.

We will also make the recommendation tighter by using text classification to recommend only articles within the same category. We will then extract a list of tags from each recommended article, which can further help readers discover new articles.

All this will be done via three Cohere API endpoints stacked together: Embed, Classify, and Chat.

/>

We will implement the following steps:

**1: Find the most similar articles to the one currently reading using embeddings.**

**2: Keep only articles of the same category using text classification.**

**3: Extract tags from these articles.**

**4: Show the top 5 recommended articles.**

## 1.1: Get articles

Throughout this article, we'll use the [BBC news article dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/data?select=BBC+News+Train.csv) as an example [\[Source\]](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html). This dataset consists of articles from a few categories: business, politics, tech, entertainment, and sport.

We'll extract a subset of the data and in Step 1, use the first 100 data points.

```python PYTHON
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/main/notebooks/data/bbc_news_subset.csv', delimiter=',')

INP_START = 0
INP_END = 100
df_inputs = df.iloc[INP_START:INP_END]
df_inputs = df_inputs.copy()

df_inputs.drop(['ArticleId','Category'],axis=1,inplace=True)

df_inputs.head()
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>Text</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## 1.2: Turn articles into embeddings

Next we turn each article text into embeddings. An [embedding](https://docs.cohere.ai/embedding-wiki) is a list of numbers that our models use to represent a piece of text, capturing its context and meaning.

We do this by calling Cohere's [Embed endpoint](https://docs.cohere.ai/embed-reference), which takes in text as input and returns embeddings as output.

```python PYTHON
articles = df_inputs['Text'].tolist()

output = co.embed(
            model ='embed-english-v3.0',
            input_type='search_document',
            texts = articles)
embeds = output.embeddings

print('Number of articles:', len(embeds))
```

```
Number of articles: 100
```

## 1.3: Pick one article and find the most similar articles

Next, we pick any one article to be the one the reader is currently reading (let's call this the target) and find other articles with the most similar embeddings (let's call these candidates) using cosine similarity.

[Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) is a metric that measures how similar sequences of numbers are (embeddings in our case), and we compute it for each target-candidate pair.

```python PYTHON
print(f'Choose one article ID between {INP_START} and {INP_END-1} below...')
```

```
Choose one article ID between 0 and 99 below...
```

```python PYTHON
READING_IDX = 70

reading = embeds[READING_IDX]
```

```python PYTHON

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def get_similarity(target,candidates):
  # Turn list into array
  candidates = np.array(candidates)
  target = np.expand_dims(np.array(target),axis=0)

  # Calculate cosine similarity
  similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(target,candidates)
  similarity_scores = np.squeeze(similarity_scores).tolist()

  # Sort by descending order in similarity
  similarity_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_scores))
  similarity_scores = sorted(similarity_scores, key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)

  # Return similarity scores
  return similarity_scores
```

```python PYTHON
similarity = get_similarity(reading,embeds)

print('Target:')
print(f'[ID {READING_IDX}]',df_inputs['Text'][READING_IDX][:100],'...','\n')

print('Candidates:')
for i in similarity[1:6]: # Exclude the target article
  print(f'[ID {i[0]}]',df_inputs['Text'][i[0]][:100],'...')
```

/>

Two articles may be similar but they may not necessarily belong to the same category. For example, an article about a sports team manager facing a fine may be similar to another about a business entity facing a fine, but they are not of the same category.

Perhaps we can make the system better by only recommending articles of the same category. For this, let's build a news category classifier.

## 2.1: Build a classifier

We use Cohere's [Classify endpoint](https://docs.cohere.ai/classify-reference) to build a news category classifier, classifying articles into five categories: Business, Politics, Tech, Entertainment, and Sport.

A typical text classification model requires hundreds/thousands of data points to train, but with this endpoint, we can build a classifier with a few as five examples per class.

To build the classifier, we need a set of examples consisting of text (news text) and labels (news category). The BBC News dataset happens to have both (columns 'Text' and 'Category'), so this time weâ€™ll use the categories for building our examples. For this, we will set aside another portion of dataset.

```python PYTHON
EX_START = 100
EX_END = 200
df_examples = df.iloc[EX_START:EX_END]
df_examples = df_examples.copy()

df_examples.drop(['ArticleId'],axis=1,inplace=True)

df_examples.head()
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>Text</th>
        <th>Category</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>100</th>
        <td>honda wins china copyright ruling japan s hond...</td>
        <td>business</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>101</th>
        <td>ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk indepe...</td>
        <td>politics</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>102</th>
        <td>security warning over fbi virus the us feder...</td>
        <td>tech</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>103</th>
        <td>europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people r...</td>
        <td>tech</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>104</th>
        <td>celebrities get to stay in jungle all four con...</td>
        <td>entertainment</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

With the Classify endpoint, there is a limit of 512 tokens per input. This means full articles won't be able to fit in the examples, so we will approximate and limit each article to its first 300 characters.

```python PYTHON
MAX_CHARS = 300

def shorten_text(text):
  return text[:MAX_CHARS]

df_examples['Text'] = df_examples['Text'].apply(shorten_text)
```

The Classify endpoint needs a minimum of 2 examples for each category. We'll have 5 examples each, sampled randomly from the dataset. We have 5 categories, so we will have a total of 25 examples.

```python PYTHON
EX_PER_CAT = 5

categories = df_examples['Category'].unique().tolist()

ex_texts = []
ex_labels = []
for category in categories:
  df_category = df_examples[df_examples['Category'] == category]
  samples = df_category.sample(n=EX_PER_CAT, random_state=42)
  ex_texts += samples['Text'].tolist()
  ex_labels += samples['Category'].tolist()

print(f'Number of examples per category: {EX_PER_CAT}')
print(f'List of categories: {categories}')
print(f'Number of categories: {len(categories)}')
print(f'Total number of examples: {len(ex_texts)}')
```

```
Number of examples per category: 5
List of categories: ['business', 'politics', 'tech', 'entertainment', 'sport']
Number of categories: 5
Total number of examples: 25
```

Once the examples are ready, we can now get the classifications. Here is a function that returns the classification given an input.

```python PYTHON

from cohere import ClassifyExample

examples = []
for txt, lbl in zip(ex_texts,ex_labels):
  examples.append(ClassifyExample(text=txt, label=lbl))

def classify_text(texts, examples):
    classifications = co.classify(
        inputs=texts,
        examples=examples
    )

    return [c.prediction for c in classifications.classifications]
```

## 2.2: Measure its performance

Before actually using the classifier, let's first test its performance. Here we take another 100 data points as the test dataset and the classifier will predict its class i.e. news category.

```python PYTHON
TEST_START = 200
TEST_END = 300
df_test = df.iloc[TEST_START:TEST_END]
df_test = df_test.copy()

df_test.drop(['ArticleId'],axis=1,inplace=True)

df_test['Text'] = df_test['Text'].apply(shorten_text)

df_test.head()
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>Text</th>
        <th>Category</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>200</th>
        <td>sa return to mauritius top seeds south africa ...</td>
        <td>sport</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>201</th>
        <td>snow patrol feted at irish awards snow patrol ...</td>
        <td>entertainment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>202</th>
        <td>clyde 0-5 celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to...</td>
        <td>sport</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>203</th>
        <td>bad weather hits nestle sales a combination of...</td>
        <td>business</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>204</th>
        <td>net fingerprints combat attacks eighty large n...</td>
        <td>tech</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

```python PYTHON
predictions = []
BATCH_SIZE = 90 # The API accepts a maximum of 96 inputs
for i in range(0, len(df_test['Text']), BATCH_SIZE):
    batch_texts = df_test['Text'][i:i+BATCH_SIZE].tolist()
    predictions.extend(classify_text(batch_texts, examples))

actual = df_test['Category'].tolist()
```

```python PYTHON
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(actual, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy*100}')
```

```
Accuracy: 89.0
```

We get a good accuracy score of 91%, so the classifier is ready to be
implemented in our recommender system.

<img
  alt="Step 3 - Extract"
  src="https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/images/article-recommender/article-rec-4.png"
/>

We now proceed to the tags extraction step. Compared to the previous two steps, this step is not about sorting or filtering articles, but rather enriching them with more information.

We do this with the Chat endpoint.

We call the endpoint by specifying a few settings, and it will generate the corresponding extractions.

```python PYTHON
def extract_tags(article):
  prompt = f"""Given an article, extract a list of tags containing keywords of that article.

  response = co.chat(

  return response.text
```

<img
  alt="Complete all steps"
  src="https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/raw/main/notebooks/images/article-recommender/article-rec-5.png"
/>

Let's now put everything together for our article recommender system.

First, we select the target article and compute the similarity scores against the candidate articles.

```python PYTHON
print(f'Choose one article ID between {INP_START} and {INP_END-1} below...')
```

```
Choose one article ID between 0 and 99 below...
```

```python PYTHON
READING_IDX = 70

reading = embeds[READING_IDX]

similarity = get_similarity(reading,embeds)
```

Next, we filter the articles via classification. Finally, we extract the keywords from each article and show the recommendations.

```python PYTHON
SHOW_TOP = 5

df_inputs = df_inputs.copy()
df_inputs['Text'] = df_inputs['Text'].apply(shorten_text)

def get_recommendations(reading_idx,similarity,show_top):

  # Show the current article
  print('------  You are reading...  ------')
  print(f'[ID {READING_IDX}] Article:',df_inputs['Text'][reading_idx][:MAX_CHARS]+'...\n')

  # Show the recommended articles
  print('------  You might also like...  ------')

  # Classify the target article
  target_class = classify_text([df_inputs['Text'][reading_idx]],examples)
  print(target_class)

  count = 0
  for idx,score in similarity:

    # Classify each candidate article
    candidate_class = classify_text([df_inputs['Text'][idx]],examples)

    # Show recommendations
    if target_class == candidate_class and idx != reading_idx:
      selection = df_inputs['Text'][idx][:MAX_CHARS]
      print(f'[ID {idx}] Article:',selection+'...')

      # Extract and show tags
      tags = extract_tags(selection)
      if tags:
          print(f'Tags: {tags.strip()}\n')
      else:
          print(f'Tags: none\n')

      # Increment the article count
      count += 1

      # Stop once articles reach the SHOW_TOP number
      if count == show_top:
        break
```

```python PYTHON
get_recommendations(READING_IDX,similarity,SHOW_TOP)
```

Keeping to the Section 1.3 example, here we see how the classification and extraction steps have improved our recommendation outcome.

In conclusion, this demonstrates an example of how we can stack multiple NLP endpoints together to get an output much closer to our desired outcome.

In practice, hosting and maintaining multiple models can turn quickly into a complex activity. But by leveraging Cohere endpoints, this task is reduced to a simple API call.
