Generative models have proven extremely useful in content idea generation. But they don’t take into account user search demand and trends. In this notebook, let’s see how we can solve that by adding keyword research into the equation.

Read the accompanying [blog post here](https://cohere.com/blog/generative-content-keyword-research/).

```python PYTHON
! pip install cohere -q
```

```python PYTHON
import cohere
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

import cohere
co = cohere.Client("COHERE_API_KEY") # Get your API key: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys
```

```python PYTHON
#@title Enable text wrapping in Google Colab

from IPython.display import HTML, display

def set_css():
  display(HTML('''

  '''))
get_ipython().events.register('pre_run_cell', set_css)
```

First, we need to get a supply of high-traffic keywords for a given topic. We can get this via keyword research tools, of which are many available. We’ll use Google Keyword Planner, which is free to use.

```python PYTHON

import wget
wget.download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/main/notebooks/data/remote_teams.csv", "remote_teams.csv")
```

```
'remote_teams.csv'
```

```python PYTHON
df = pd.read_csv('remote_teams.csv')
df.columns = ["keyword","volume"]
df.head()
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe fern-table">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>keyword</th>
        <th>volume</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>managing remote teams</td>
        <td>1000</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>remote teams</td>
        <td>390</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>collaboration tools for remote teams</td>
        <td>320</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td>online games for remote teams</td>
        <td>320</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>how to manage remote teams</td>
        <td>260</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

We now have a list of keywords, but this list is still raw. For example, “managing remote teams” is the top-ranking keyword in this list. But at the same time, there are many similar keywords further down in the list, such as “how to effectively manage remote teams.”

We can do that by clustering them into topics. For this, we’ll leverage Cohere’s Embed endpoint and scikit-learn.

### Embed the Keywords with Cohere Embed

The Cohere Embed endpoint turns a text input into a text embedding.

```python PYTHON
def embed_text(texts):
  output = co.embed(
                texts=texts,
                model='embed-english-v3.0',
                input_type="search_document",
                )
  return output.embeddings

embeds = np.array(embed_text(df['keyword'].tolist()))
```

### Cluster the Keywords into Topics with scikit-learn

We then use these embeddings to cluster the keywords. A common term used for this exercise is “topic modeling.” Here, we can leverage scikit-learn’s KMeans module, a machine learning algorithm for clustering.

```python PYTHON
NUM_TOPICS = 4
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=NUM_TOPICS, random_state=21, n_init="auto").fit(embeds)
df['topic'] = list(kmeans.labels_)
df.head()
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe fern-table">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>keyword</th>
        <th>volume</th>
        <th>topic</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>managing remote teams</td>
        <td>1000</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>remote teams</td>
        <td>390</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>collaboration tools for remote teams</td>
        <td>320</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td>online games for remote teams</td>
        <td>320</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>how to manage remote teams</td>
        <td>260</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Generate Topic Names with Cohere Chat

We use the Chat to generate a topic name for that cluster.

```python PYTHON
topic_keywords_dict = {topic: list(set(group['keyword'])) for topic, group in df.groupby('topic')}
```

```python PYTHON
def generate_topic_name(keywords):
    # Construct the prompt
    prompt = f"""Generate a concise topic name that best represents these keywords.\
Provide just the topic name and not any additional details.

Keywords: {', '.join(keywords)}"""

    # Call the Cohere API
    response = co.chat(
        model='command-r',  # Choose the model size
        message=prompt,
        preamble="")

    # Return the generated text
    return response.text
```

```python PYTHON
topic_name_mapping = {topic: generate_topic_name(keywords) for topic, keywords in topic_keywords_dict.items()}

df['topic_name'] = df['topic'].map(topic_name_mapping)

df.head()
```

<div>
  <table border="1" class="dataframe fern-table">
    <thead>
      <tr style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>
        <th></th>
        <th>keyword</th>
        <th>volume</th>
        <th>topic</th>
        <th>topic_name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>managing remote teams</td>
        <td>1000</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Remote Team Management</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>remote teams</td>
        <td>390</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Remote Team Tools and Tips</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>collaboration tools for remote teams</td>
        <td>320</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Remote Team Tools and Tips</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td>online games for remote teams</td>
        <td>320</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Remote Team Fun</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>how to manage remote teams</td>
        <td>260</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Remote Team Management</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

```python PYTHON
for topic, name in topic_name_mapping.items():
    print(f"Topic {topic}: {name}")
```

```
Topic 0: Remote Team Management
Topic 1: Remote Team Tools and Tips
Topic 2: Remote Team Resources
Topic 3: Remote Team Fun
```

Now that we have the keywords nicely grouped into topics, we can proceed to generate the content ideas.

### Take the Top Keywords from Each Topic

Here we can implement a filter to take just the top N keywords from each topic, sorted by the search volume. In our case, we use 10.

```python PYTHON
TOP_N = 10

top_keywords = (df.groupby('topic')
                        .apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(TOP_N, 'volume'))
                        .reset_index(drop=True))


content_by_topic = {}
for topic, group in top_keywords.groupby('topic'):
    keywords = ', '.join(list(group['keyword']))
    topic2name = topic2name = dict(df.groupby('topic')['topic_name'].first())
    topic_name = topic2name[topic]
    content_by_topic[topic] = {'topic_name': topic_name, 'keywords': keywords}
```

```python PYTHON
content_by_topic
```

```
{0: {'topic_name': 'Remote Team Management',
  'keywords': 'managing remote teams, how to manage remote teams, leading remote teams, managing remote teams best practices, remote teams best practices, best practices for managing remote teams, manage remote teams, building culture in remote teams, culture building for remote teams, managing remote teams training'},
 1: {'topic_name': 'Remote Team Tools and Tips',
  'keywords': 'remote teams, collaboration tools for remote teams, team building for remote teams, scrum remote teams, tools for remote teams, zapier remote teams, working agreements for remote teams, working with remote teams, free collaboration tools for remote teams, free retrospective tools for remote teams'},
 2: {'topic_name': 'Remote Team Resources',
  'keywords': 'best collaboration tools for remote teams, slack best practices for remote teams, best communication tools for remote teams, best tools for remote teams, always on video for remote teams, best apps for remote teams, best free collaboration tools for remote teams, best games for remote teams, best gifts for remote teams, best ice breaker questions for remote teams'},
 3: {'topic_name': 'Remote Team Fun',
  'keywords': 'online games for remote teams, team building activities for remote teams, games for remote teams, retrospective ideas for remote teams, team building ideas for remote teams, fun retrospective ideas for remote teams, retro ideas for remote teams, team building exercises for remote teams, trust building exercises for remote teams, activities for remote teams'}}
```

### Create a Prompt with These Keywords

Next, we use the Chat endpoint to produce the content ideas. The prompt we’ll use is as follows

```python PYTHON
def generate_blog_ideas(keywords):
  prompt = f"""{keywords}\n\nThe above is a list of high-traffic keywords obtained from a keyword research tool.
Suggest three blog post ideas that are highly relevant to these keywords.
For each idea, write a one paragraph abstract about the topic.
Use this format:
Blog title: <text>
Abstract: <text>"""

  response = co.chat(
    model='command-r',
    message = prompt)
  return response.text

```

### Generate Content Ideas

Next, we generate the blog post ideas. It takes in a string of keywords, calls the Chat endpoint, and returns the generated text.

```python PYTHON
for key,value in content_by_topic.items():
  value['ideas'] = generate_blog_ideas(value['keywords'])


for key,value in content_by_topic.items():
  print(f"Topic Name: {value['topic_name']}\n")
  print(f"Top Keywords: {value['keywords']}\n")
  print(f"Blog Post Ideas: {value['ideas']}\n")
  print("-"*50)
```

```
