# How to build a CSV Agent without using deprecated `create_csv_agent` - langchain-cohere

Starting from version 0.3.5 of the langchain-cohere package, the `create_csv_agent` abstraction has been deprecated.
In this guide, we will demonstrate how to build a custom CSV agent without it.

```
!pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-experimental langchain-cohere pandas -qq
```


```python
# Import packages
from datetime import datetime
from io import IOBase

### Define tools necessary for the agent
The below cell introduces a suite of tools that are provided to the csv agent. These tools allow the agent to fcilitate meaningful interactions with uploaded files and providing Python code execution functionality. The toolkit comprises three main components:


**File Peek Tool**: Offers a convenient way to inspect a CSV file by providing a quick preview of the first few rows in a Markdown format, making it easy to get a glimpse of the data.

**File Read Tool**: Allows for a comprehensive exploration of the CSV file by reading and presenting its full contents in a user-friendly Markdown format.

**Python Interpreter Tool**: Enables secure execution of Python code within a sandboxed environment, providing users with the output of the code execution.


```python
# Define tools that we want the csv agent to have access to


def get_file_peek_tool() -> Tool:
    def file_peek(filename: str, num_rows: int = 5) -> str:
        """Returns the first textual contents of an uploaded file

        Args:
            table_path: the table path
            num_rows: the number of rows of the table to preview.
        """  # noqa E501
        if ".csv" in filename:
            return pd.read_csv(filename).head(num_rows).to_markdown()
        else:
            return "the table_path was not recognised"

    class file_peek_inputs(BaseModel):
        filename: str = Field(
            description="The name of the attached file to show a peek preview."
        )

    file_peek_tool = Tool(

    )

    return file_peek_tool


def get_file_read_tool() -> Tool:
    def file_read(filename: str) -> str:
        """Returns the textual contents of an uploaded file, broken up in text chunks

        Args:
            filename (str): The name of the attached file to read.
        """  # noqa E501
        if ".csv" in filename:
            return pd.read_csv(filename).to_markdown()
        else:
            return "the table_path was not recognised"

    class file_read_inputs(BaseModel):
        filename: str = Field(
            description="The name of the attached file to read."
        )

    file_read_tool = Tool(
        name="file_read",
        description="Returns the textual contents of an uploaded file, broken up in text chunks",  # noqa E501
        func=file_read,
        args_schema=file_read_inputs,
    )

    return file_read_tool


def get_python_tool() -> Tool:
    """Returns a tool that will execute python code and return the output."""

    def python_interpreter(code: str) -> str:
        """A function that will return the output of the python code.

        Args:
            code: the python code to run.
        """
        return python_repl.run(code)

    python_repl = PythonAstREPLTool()
    python_tool = Tool(
        name="python_interpreter",
        description="Executes python code and returns the result. The code runs in a static sandbox without interactive mode, so print output or save output to a file.",  # noqa E501
        func=python_interpreter,
    )

    class PythonToolInput(BaseModel):
        code: str = Field(description="Python code to execute.")

    python_tool.args_schema = PythonToolInput
    return python_tool
```

### Create helper functions
In the cell below, we will create some important helper functions that we can call to properly assemble the full prompt that the csv agent can utilize.


```python
def create_prompt(
    system_message: Optional[BaseMessage] = SystemMessage(
        content="You are a helpful AI assistant."
    ),

        List[BaseMessagePromptTemplate]
    ] = None,
) -> ChatPromptTemplate:
    """Create prompt for this agent.

    Args:

            first in the prompt.
        extra_prompt_messages: Prompt messages that will be placed between the
            system message and the new human input.

    Returns:
        A prompt template to pass into this agent.
    """
    _prompts = extra_prompt_messages or []
    messages: List[Union[BaseMessagePromptTemplate, BaseMessage]]
    if system_message:
        messages = [system_message]
    else:
        messages = []

    messages.extend(
        [
            *_prompts,
            HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template("{input}"),
            MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),
        ]
    )
    return ChatPromptTemplate(messages=messages)


def _get_csv_head_str(path: str, number_of_head_rows: int) -> str:
    with open(path, "r") as file:
        lines = []
        for _ in range(number_of_head_rows):
            lines.append(file.readline().strip("\n"))
        # validate that the head contents are well formatted csv

        return " ".join(lines)

) -> ChatPromptTemplate:
    if isinstance(path, str):
        lines = _get_csv_head_str(path, number_of_head_rows)
        prompt_message = f"The user uploaded the following attachments:\nFilename: {path}\nWord Count: {count_words_in_file(path)}\nPreview: {lines}"  # noqa: E501

            )
        prompt_message = " ".join(prompt_messages)

    prompt = create_prompt(
        system_message=HumanMessage(prompt_message)
    )
    return prompt

    try:
        with open(file_path, "r") as file:
            content = file.readlines()
            words = [len(sentence.split()) for sentence in content]
            return sum(words)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found.")
        return 0
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", str(e))
        return 0
```

### Build the core csv agent abstraction
The cells below outline the assembly of the various components to build an agent abstraction tailored for intelligent CSV file interactions. We use langchain to provide the agent that has access to the tools declared above, along with additional capabilities to provide additional tools if needed, and put together an agentic abstraction using the prompts defined earlier to deliver an abstraction that can easily be called for natural language querying over csv files!


```python
# Build the agent abstraction itself
def create_csv_agent(
    llm: BaseLanguageModel,
    path: Union[str, List[str]],
    extra_tools: List[BaseTool] = [],
    pandas_kwargs: Optional[dict] = None,
    prompt: Optional[ChatPromptTemplate] = None,
    number_of_head_rows: int = 5,
    verbose: bool = True,
    return_intermediate_steps: bool = True,
) -> AgentExecutor:
    """Create csv agent with the specified language model.

    Args:
        llm: Language model to use for the agent.
        path: A string path, or a list of string paths
            that can be read in as pandas DataFrames with pd.read_csv().
        number_of_head_rows: Number of rows to display in the prompt for sample data
        include_df_in_prompt: Display the DataFrame sample values in the prompt.
        pandas_kwargs: Named arguments to pass to pd.read_csv().
        prefix: Prompt prefix string.
        suffix: Prompt suffix string.
        prompt: Prompt to use for the agent. This takes precedence over the other prompt arguments, such as suffix and prefix.
        temp_path_dir: Temporary directory to store the csv files in for the python repl.
        delete_temp_path: Whether to delete the temporary directory after the agent is done. This only works if temp_path_dir is not provided.

    Returns:
        An AgentExecutor with the specified agent_type agent and access to
        a PythonREPL and any user-provided extra_tools.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain_cohere import ChatCohere, create_csv_agent

            llm = ChatCohere(model="command-a-03-2025", temperature=0)
            agent_executor = create_csv_agent(

            )
            resp = agent_executor.invoke({"input":"How many people were on the titanic?"})

# Using the CSV agent

Let's create a dummy CSV file for demo


```python
import csv

# Data to be written to the CSV file
data = [
    ["movie", "name", "num_tickets"],
    ["The Shawshank Redemption", "John", 2],
    ["The Shawshank Redemption", "Jerry", 2],
    ["The Shawshank Redemption", "Jack", 4],
    ["The Shawshank Redemption", "Jeremy", 2],
    ["Finding Nemo", "Darren", 3],
    ["Finding Nemo", "Jones", 2],
    ["Finding Nemo", "King", 1],
    ["Finding Nemo", "Penelope", 5],
]

file_path = "movies_tickets.csv"

with open(file_path, "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)

print(f"CSV file created successfully at {file_path}.")
```

    CSV file created successfully at movies_tickets.csv.


Let's use our CSV Agent to interact with the CSV file


```python
# Try out an example
llm = ChatCohere(model="command-a-03-2025", temperature=0)
agent_executor = create_csv_agent(llm, "movies_tickets.csv")
resp = agent_executor.invoke(
    {"input": "Who all watched Shawshank redemption?"}
)
print(resp.get("output"))
```
    The output returned is:

```
John, Jerry, Jack and Jeremy watched Shawshank Redemption.
```
