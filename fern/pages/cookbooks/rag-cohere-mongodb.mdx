## Step 1: Install libaries and Set Environment Variables

Critical Security Reminder: Safeguard your production environment by never committing sensitive information, such as environment variable values, to public repositories. This practice is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your systems.

Libraries:
* `cohere`: A Python library for accessing Cohere's large language models, enabling natural language processing tasks like text generation, classification, and embedding.
* `pymongo`: The recommended Python driver for MongoDB, allowing Python applications to interact with MongoDB databases for data storage and retrieval.
* `datasets`: A library by Hugging Face that provides easy access to a wide range of datasets for machine learning and natural language processing tasks.
*`tqdm`: A fast, extensible progress bar library for Python, useful for displaying progress in long-running operations or loops.



```python
!pip install --quiet datasets tqdm cohere pymongo
```


```python
import os
import cohere

os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = ""
co = cohere.Client(os.environ.get("COHERE_API_KEY"))

os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = ""
```

## Step 2: Data Loading and Preparation
**Dataset Information**

This dataset contains detailed information about multiple technology companies in the Information Technology sector. For each company, the dataset includes:

1. Company name and stock ticker symbol
2. Market analysis reports for recent years (typically 2023 and 2024), which include:
  - Title and author of the report
  - Date of publication
  - Detailed content covering financial performance, product innovations, market position, challenges, and future outlook
  - Stock recommendations and price targets

3. Key financial metrics such as:
  - Current stock price
  - 52-week price range
  - Market capitalization
  - Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
  - Dividend yield


4. Recent news items, typically including:
  - Date of the news
  - Headline
  - Brief summary

The market analysis reports provide in-depth information about each company's performance, innovations, challenges, and future prospects. They offer insights into the companies' strategies, market positions, and potential for growth.


```python
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset

# Make sure you have an Hugging Face token(HF_TOKEN) in your development environemnt before running the code below
# How to get a token: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens
# https://huggingface.co/datasets/MongoDB/fake_tech_companies_market_reports
dataset = load_dataset("MongoDB/fake_tech_companies_market_reports", split="train", streaming=True)
dataset_df = dataset.take(100)

# Convert the dataset to a pandas dataframe
dataset_df = pd.DataFrame(dataset_df)
dataset_df.head(5)

## Step 3: Embedding Generation with Cohere


```python
from tqdm import tqdm

def get_embedding(text: str, input_type: str="search_document") -> list[float]:
  if not text.strip():
    print("Attempted to get embedding for empty text.")
    return []

  model = "embed-english-v3.0"
  response = co.embed(
    texts=[text],
    model=model,
    input_type=input_type, # Used for embeddings of search queries run against a vector DB to find relevant documents
    embedding_types=['float']
  )

  return response.embeddings.float[0]

# Apply the embedding function with a progress bar
tqdm.pandas(desc="Generating embeddings")
dataset_df["embedding"] = dataset_df['combined_attributes'].progress_apply(get_embedding)

print(f"We just computed {len(dataset_df['embedding'])} embeddings.")
```
    We just computed 63 embeddings.

## Step 4: MongoDB Vector Database and Connection Setup


MongoDB acts as both an operational and a vector database for the RAG system.
MongoDB Atlas specifically provides a database solution that efficiently stores, queries and retrieves vector embeddings.

Creating a database and collection within MongoDB is made simple with MongoDB Atlas.

1. First, register for a [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register). For existing users, sign into MongoDB Atlas.
2. [Follow the instructions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/). Select Atlas UI as the procedure to deploy your first cluster.
3. Create the database: `asset_management_use_case`.
4. Within the database ` asset_management_use_case`, create the collection `market_reports`.
5. Create a [vector search index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/create-index/#procedure/) named vector_index for the â€˜listings_reviewsâ€™ collection. This index enables the RAG application to retrieve records as additional context to supplement user queries via vector search. Below is the JSON definition of the data collection vector search index.

Your vector search index created on MongoDB Atlas should look like below:

```
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "numDimensions": 1024,
      "path": "embedding",
      "similarity": "cosine",
      "type": "vector"
    }
  ]
}

```

Follow MongoDBâ€™s [steps to get the connection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) string from the Atlas UI. After setting up the database and obtaining the Atlas cluster connection URI, securely store the URI within your development environment.


```python
import os
os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = ""
```


```python
import pymongo

def get_mongo_client(mongo_uri):
  """Establish and validate connection to the MongoDB."""

  client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_uri, appname="devrel.showcase.rag.cohere_mongodb.python")

  # Validate the connection
  ping_result = client.admin.command('ping')
  if ping_result.get('ok') == 1.0:
    # Connection successful
    print("Connection to MongoDB successful")
    return client
  else:
    print("Connection to MongoDB failed")
  return None

MONGO_URI = os.environ["MONGO_URI"]

if not MONGO_URI:
  print("MONGO_URI not set in environment variables")

mongo_client = get_mongo_client(MONGO_URI)

DB_NAME = "asset_management_use_case"
COLLECTION_NAME = "market_reports"

db = mongo_client.get_database(DB_NAME)
collection = db.get_collection(COLLECTION_NAME)
```

    Connection to MongoDB successful



```python
# Delete any existing records in the collection
collection.delete_many({})
```


```

DeleteResult({'n': 63, 'electionId': ObjectId('7fffffff000000000000002b'), 'opTime': {'ts': Timestamp(1721913981, 63), 't': 43}, 'ok': 1.0, '$clusterTime': {'clusterTime': Timestamp(1721913981, 63), 'signature': {'hash': b'cU;+\xe3\xbdRc\t\x80\xad\x03\x16\x11\x18\xe6s\xebF\x01', 'keyId': 7353740577831124994}}, 'operationTime': Timestamp(1721913981, 63)}, acknowledged=True)

```

## Step 5: Data Ingestion

MongoDB's Document model and its compatibility with Python dictionaries offer several benefits for data ingestion.

* Document-oriented structure:
  * MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents: BSON(Binary JSON).
  * This aligns naturally with Python dictionaries, allowing for seamless data representation using key value pair data structures.
* Schema flexibility:
  * MongoDB is schema-less, meaning each document in a collection can have a different structure.
  * This flexibility matches Python's dynamic nature, allowing you to ingest varied data structures without predefined schemas.
* Efficient ingestion:
  * The similarity between Python dictionaries and MongoDB documents allows for direct ingestion without complex transformations.
  * This leads to faster data insertion and reduced processing overhead.

![](../../assets/images/rag-cohere-mongodb-4.png)

```python
documents = dataset_df.to_dict('records')
collection.insert_many(documents)

print("Data ingestion into MongoDB completed")
```

    Data ingestion into MongoDB completed


## Step 6: MongoDB Query language and Vector Search

**Query flexibility**

MongoDB's query language is designed to work well with document structures, making it easy to query and manipulate ingested data using familiar Python-like syntax.


**Aggregation Pipeline**

MongoDB's aggregation pipelines is a powerful feature of the MongoDB Database that allows for complex data processing and analysis within the database.
Aggregation pipeline can be thought of similarly to pipelines in data engineering or machine learning, where processes operate sequentially, each stage taking an input, performing operations, and providing an output for the next stage.

**Stages**

Stages are the building blocks of an aggregation pipeline.
Each stage represents a specific data transformation or analysis operation.
Common stages include:
  - `$match`: Filters documents (similar to WHERE in SQL)
  - `$group`: Groups documents by specified fields
  - `$sort`: Sorts the documents
  - `$project`: Reshapes documents (select, rename, compute fields)
  - `$limit`: Limits the number of documents
  - `$unwind`: Deconstructs array fields
  - `$lookup`: Performs left outer joins with other collections

![](../../assets/images/rag-cohere-mongodb-5.png)

```python
def vector_search(user_query, collection):
  """
  Perform a vector search in the MongoDB collection based on the user query.

  Args:
  user_query (str): The user's query string.
  collection (MongoCollection): The MongoDB collection to search.

  Returns:
  list: A list of matching documents.
  """

  # Generate embedding for the user query
  query_embedding = get_embedding(user_query, input_type="search_query")

  if query_embedding is None:
    return "Invalid query or embedding generation failed."

  # Define the vector search pipeline
  vector_search_stage = {
    "$vectorSearch": {
      "index": "vector_index",
      "queryVector": query_embedding,
      "path": "embedding",
      "numCandidates": 150,  # Number of candidate matches to consider
      "limit": 5  # Return top 4 matches
    }
  }

  unset_stage = {
    "$unset": "embedding"  # Exclude the 'embedding' field from the results
  }

  project_stage = {
    "$project": {
      "_id": 0,  # Exclude the _id field
      "company": 1,  # Include the plot field
      "reports": 1,  # Include the title field
      "combined_attributes": 1, # Include the genres field
      "score": {
        "$meta": "vectorSearchScore"  # Include the search score
      }
    }
  }

  pipeline = [vector_search_stage, unset_stage, project_stage]

  # Execute the search
  results = collection.aggregate(pipeline)
  return list(results)

```

## Step 7:  Add the Cohere Reranker
Cohere rerank functions as a second stage search that can improve the precision of your first stage search results

![](../../assets/images/rag-cohere-mongodb-6.png)

```python

def rerank_documents(query: str, documents, top_n: int = 3):
    # Perform reranking with Cohere ReRank Model
    try:
        response = co.rerank(
            model="rerank-english-v3.0",
            query=query,
            documents=documents,
            top_n=top_n,
            rank_fields=["company", "reports", "combined_attributes"]
        )

        # Extract the top reranked documents
        top_documents_after_rerank = []
        for result in response.results:
            original_doc = documents[result.index]
            top_documents_after_rerank.append({
                'company': original_doc['company'],
                'combined_attributes': original_doc['combined_attributes'],
                'reports': original_doc['reports'],
                'vector_search_score': original_doc['score'],
                'relevance_score': result.relevance_score
            })

        return top_documents_after_rerank

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during reranking: {e}")
        return documents[:top_n]  # Return top N documents without reranking
```


```python
import pprint

query = "What companies have negative market reports or negative sentiment that might deter from investment in the long term"

get_knowledge = vector_search(query, collection)
pd.DataFrame(get_knowledge).head()
```

## Step 8: Handling User Queries


```python
def format_documents_for_chat(documents):
  return [
    {
        "company": doc['company'],
        # "reports": doc['reports'],
        "combined_attributes": doc['combined_attributes']
    }
    for doc in documents
  ]

# Generating response with Cohere Command R
response = co.chat(
  message=query,
  documents=format_documents_for_chat(reranked_documents),
  model="command-r-plus",
  temperature=0.3
)

print("Final answer:")
print(response.text)
```

    Final answer:
