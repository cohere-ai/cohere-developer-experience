Cohere has a variety of models that cover many different use cases. If you need more customization, you can [train a model](/docs/fine-tuning) to tune it to your specific use case.

Cohere models are currently available on the following platforms:

- [Cohere’s proprietary platform](https://dashboard.cohere.com/playground/chat)
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=87af0c85-6cf9-4ed8-bee0-b40ce65167e0)
- [Amazon Bedrock](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-west-2#/providers?model=cohere.command-r-plus-v1:0)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/?tid=694fed05-7f6d-4ab2-8c38-9afb438eab6f&selectedCollection=cohere)
- [Oracle GenAI Service](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/generative-ai-service/)

At the end of each major sections below, you'll find technical details about how to call a given model on a particular platform.

## What can These Models Be Used For?

In this section, we'll provide some high-level context on Cohere's offerings, and what the strengths of each are.

- The Command family of models includes [Command](https://cohere.com/models/command?_gl=1*15hfaqm*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..), [Command R](/docs/command-r), and [Command R+](/docs/command-r-plus). Together, they are the text-generation LLMs powering conversational agents, summarization, copywriting, and similar use cases. They work through the [Chat](/reference/chat) endpoint, which can be used with or without [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG).
- [Rerank](https://cohere.com/blog/rerank/?_gl=1*1t6ls4x*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..) is the fastest way to inject the intelligence of a language model into an existing search system. It can be accessed via the [Rerank](/reference/rerank-1) endpoint.
- [Embed](https://cohere.com/models/embed?_gl=1*1t6ls4x*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..) improves the accuracy of search, classification, clustering, and RAG results. It also powers the [Embed](/reference/embed) and [Classify](/reference/classify) endpoints.

## Command

Command is Cohere's default generation model that takes a user instruction (or command) and generates text following the instruction. Our Command models also have conversational capabilities which means that they are well-suited for chat applications.

## Embed

These models can be used to generate embeddings from text or classify it based on various parameters. Embeddings can be used for estimating semantic similarity between two sentences, choosing a sentence which is most likely to follow another sentence, or categorizing user feedback, while outputs from the Classify endpoint can be used for any classification or analysis task. The Representation model comes with a variety of helper functions, such as for detecting the language of an input.

In this table we've listed older `v2.0` models alongside the newer `v3.0` models, but we recommend you use the `v3.0` versions.

### Using Embed Models on Different Platforms

## Rerank

The Rerank model can improve created models by re-organizing their results based on certain parameters. This can be used to improve search algorithms.

| Model Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | Modalities     | Context Length | Endpoints                   |

| `rerank-multilingual-v3.0` | A model for documents and semi-structure data (JSON) that are not in English. Supports the same languages as embed-multilingual-v3.0. This model has a context length of 4096 tokens.     | Text           | 4k             | [Rerank](/reference/rerank) |

<br />

<Note> 
Rerank accepts full strings rather than tokens, so the token limit works a little differently. Rerank will automatically chunk documents longer than 510 tokens, and there is therefore no explicit limit to how long a document can be when using rerank. See our [best practice guide](/docs/reranking-best-practices) for more info about formatting documents for the Rerank endpoint.
