Cohere has a variety of models that cover many different use cases. If you need more customization, you can [train a model](/docs/fine-tuning) to tune it to your specific use case.

Cohere models are currently available on the following platforms:

- [Cohere’s proprietary platform](https://dashboard.cohere.com/playground/chat)
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=87af0c85-6cf9-4ed8-bee0-b40ce65167e0)
- [Amazon Bedrock](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-west-2#/providers?model=cohere.command-r-plus-v1:0)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/?tid=694fed05-7f6d-4ab2-8c38-9afb438eab6f&selectedCollection=cohere)
- [Oracle GenAI Service](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/generative-ai-service/)

At the end of each major section below, you'll find technical details about how to call a given model on a particular platform.

## What can These Models Be Used For?

In this section, we'll provide some high-level context on Cohere's offerings, and what the strengths of each are.

- The Command family of models includes [Command A](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a), [Command R7B](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r7b), [Command A Translate](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-translate), [Command A Reasoning](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-reasoning), [Command A Vision](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a-vision), [Command R+](/docs/command-r-plus), [Command R](/docs/command-r), and [Command](https://cohere.com/models/command?_gl=1*15hfaqm*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..). Together, they are the text-generation LLMs powering tool-using agents, [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG), translation, copywriting, and similar use cases. They work through the [Chat](/reference/chat) endpoint, which can be used with or without RAG.
- [Rerank](https://cohere.com/blog/rerank/?_gl=1*1t6ls4x*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..) is the fastest way to inject the intelligence of a language model into an existing search system. It can be accessed via the [Rerank](/reference/rerank-1) endpoint.
- [Embed](https://cohere.com/models/embed?_gl=1*1t6ls4x*_ga*MTAxNTg1NTM1MS4xNjk1MjMwODQw*_ga_CRGS116RZS*MTcxNzYwMzYxMy4zNTEuMS4xNzE3NjAzNjUxLjIyLjAuMA..) improves the accuracy of search, classification, clustering, and RAG results. It powers the [Embed](/reference/embed) endpoint.
- The [Aya](https://cohere.com/research/aya) family of models are aimed at expanding the number of languages covered by generative AI. Aya Expanse covers 23 languages, and Aya Vision is fully multimodal, allowing you to pass in images and text and get a single coherent response. Both are available on the [Chat](/reference/chat) endpoint.

## Command

Command is Cohere's default generation model that takes a user instruction (or command) and generates text following the instruction. Our Command models also have conversational capabilities, meaning they are well-suited for chat applications, and Command A Vision can interact with [image inputs](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/image-inputs).

## Embed

These models can be used to generate embeddings from text or classify it based on various parameters. Embeddings can be used for estimating semantic similarity between two sentences, choosing a sentence which is most likely to follow another sentence, or categorizing user feedback. The Representation model comes with a variety of helper functions, such as for detecting the language of an input.

## Rerank

The Rerank model can improve created models by re-organizing their results based on certain parameters. This can be used to improve search algorithms.

<br />

<Note> 
Rerank accepts full strings rather than tokens, so the token limit works a little differently. Rerank will automatically chunk documents longer than 510 tokens, and there is therefore no explicit limit to how long a document can be when using rerank. See our [best practice guide](/docs/reranking-best-practices) for more info about formatting documents for the Rerank endpoint.
