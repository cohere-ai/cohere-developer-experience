Rerank models sort text inputs by semantic relevance to a specified query. They are often used to sort search results  returned from an existing search solution. Learn more about using Rerank in the [best practices guide](/docs/reranking-best-practices).

<Note> 
Rerank accepts full strings and than tokens, so the token limit works a little differently. Rerank will automatically chunk documents longer than 4096 tokens, and there is therefore no explicit limit to how long a document can be when using rerank. See our [best practice guide](/docs/reranking-best-practices) for more info about formatting documents for the Rerank endpoint.
