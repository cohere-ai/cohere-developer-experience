Automated translation from one language to another is one of the oldest applications of machine learning. Today's LLMs have proven remarkably effective for these kinds of tasks, and Command A Translate is Cohere’s state of the art entry into the machine translation field. It excels at a variety of translation tasks on 23 languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, Persian.

Command A Translate has a context length of 16K tokens (8K for input and 8K for output), 111B parameters, and can run on one or two GPUs (A100s / H100s).

## What Can Command A Translate be Used For?

Command A Translate is excellent for translation tasks where you need answers that combine high quality and a low error rate. When utilized as part of our [private deployment](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/private-deployment-overview) options, it is the best choice for enterprises wanting to translate data _securely_.

## Getting Started

You can perform translation of a text into another language with a simple prompt asking the model to translate a piece of text. In the sample below, we are doing this 'programmatically' by passing both the target language and content to translate as variables, but you can also just pass in a `message` saying "please translate this into <target_language> for me."

```python PYTHON 
from cohere import ClientV2

co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

target_language = "Spanish"
content_to_translate = "Initial applications to Harvard for a psychology masters were rejected, but was eventually admitted. The initial setbacks were due to Milgramm not taking any undergraduate courses in psychology at Queens College. In 1961, Milgram received a PhD in social psychology. He became an assistant professor at Yale around the same time."

message = f"Translate everything that follows into {target_language}:\n\n{content_to_translate}"
response = co.chat(
    model="command-a-translate-08-2025",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}],
)
print(response.message.content[0].text)
```

Here’s a sample output:

```python PYTHON 
Las primeras solicitudes de ingreso a Harvard para cursar un máster en psicología fueron rechazadas, pero finalmente fue admitido. Los primeros contratiempos se debieron a que Milgram no había cursado ninguna asignatura de psicología de grado en el Queens College. En 1961, Milgram obtuvo un doctorado en psicología social. Por esas mismas fechas se convirtió en profesor adjunto en Yale.
```

## Conclusion 
Command A Translate is great for one-shot translations but can also be embedded into more complicated workflows, such as translating long texts or translating in multiple steps. Check out our cookbook for example implementations.
