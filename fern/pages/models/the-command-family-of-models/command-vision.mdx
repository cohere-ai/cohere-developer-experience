Command A Vision is Cohere's first multimodal model capable of understanding and interpreting visual data alongside text. With a 32K context length and support for up to 20 images per request, Command Vision excels at enterprise use cases including document analysis, chart interpretation, optical character recognition (OCR), and multilingual image processing. The model maintains the same familiar API interface as other Command models, making it easy to integrate vision capabilities into existing applications while supporting six languages: English, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, and Spanish.

| `command-a-vision`       | Command A Vision is our first model capable of processing images, excelling in enterprise use cases such as analyzing charts, graphs, and diagrams, table understanding, OCR, document Q&A, and object detection. It officially supports English, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, and Spanish.                                                              | Text, Images      | 32K            | 8K                    | [Chat](/reference/chat)                                                                    |

## What Can Command A Vision be Used For?
Command A Vision is excellent in enterprise use cases such as:

- Analysis of charts, graphs, and diagrams;
- Extracting and understanding in-image tables;
- Document optical character recognition (OCR) and question answering;
- Natural-language image processing.

## Limitations
Be aware that [tool use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tools) isn't supported as yet, though it may be in future iterations.

Also, it's important to mention that Command A Vision can _process_ images, but doesn't generate them.
