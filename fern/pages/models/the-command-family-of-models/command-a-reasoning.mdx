Command A Reasoning is Cohere's first reasoning model to date, excelling at real world enterprise tasks including tool use, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), agents, and multilingual use cases. At 111B parameters, Command A Reasoning has a context length of 256K, and can run on one or two GPUs (A100s / H100s).

| `command-a-reasoning-08-2025`      | Command A Reasoning is Cohere's first reasoning model, able to 'think' before generating an output in a way that allows it to perform well in certain kinds of nuanced problem-solving and agent-based tasks.                                                                                                                                  | Text              | 256k           | 32k                   | [Chat](/reference/chat)|

## What Can Command A Reasoning Be Used For?
Command A Reasoning is excellent for:
- **Agentic Use Cases**: Taking autonomous actions and interacting with the environment to solve problems.
- **Tool Use**: Able to leverage a variety of tools, such as search engines and APIs.
- **Multilingual**: Able to reason over multilingual inputs, providing support to user queries in 23 different languages.

There's more to be said about token budgets, enabling and disabling the `thinking` operation, etc., which can be found in our dedicated [Reasoning guide](/docs/reasoning).
