## Description

Command A Reasoning is Cohere's first reasoning model to date, excelling at real world enterprise tasks including tool use, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), agents, and multilingual use cases. At 111B parameters, Command A has a context length of 256K. Command-a-Reasoning (CAR) is optimized to run on 4x H100 GPUs for production workloads. For non-production tasks such as tryouts and evaluations, it can also run on 4x A100 GPUs.

## What Can Command A Reasoning Be Used For?
Command A is excellent for:
- **Agentic Use Cases**: Taking autonomous actions and interacting with the environment to solve problems.
- **Tool Use**: Able to leverage a variety of tools, such as search engines and APIs.
- **Multilingual**: Able to reason over multilingual inputs, providing support to user queries in 23 different languages.

There's more to be said about token budgets, enabling and disabling the `thinking` operation, etc., which can be found in our dedicated [Reasoning guide](/docs/reasoning).
