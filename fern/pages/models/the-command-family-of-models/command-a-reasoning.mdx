Command A Reasoning is Cohere's first reasoning model to date, excelling at real world enterprise tasks including tool use, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), agents, and multilingual use cases. At 111B parameters, Command A has a context length of 256K and only requires two GPUs (A100s / H100s) to run.

| `command-a-reasoning-08-2025`      | Command A Reasoning is Cohere's first reasoning model, able to 'think' before generating an output in a way that allows it to perform well in certain kinds of nuanced problem-solving, code-generation, and agent-based tasks.                                                                                                                                  | Text              | 256k           | 64k                   | [Chat](/reference/chat)|

## What Can Command A Reasoning Be Used For?
Command A is excellent for:
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex equations into manageable steps
- **Code Analysis and Generation**: Planning program structure before writing actual code
- **Logical Reasoning**: Working through multi-step arguments systematically
- **Data Analysis**: Planning analysis approaches before executing them
- **Creative Problem Solving**: Exploring different solution paths before selecting the best approach

There's more to be said about token budgets, enabling and disabling the `thinking` operation, etc., which can be found in our dedicated Reasoning docs.
