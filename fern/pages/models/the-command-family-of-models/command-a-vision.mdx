## Description

Command A Vision is Cohere's first multimodal model capable of understanding and interpreting visual data alongside text. With a 128K context length and support for up to 20 images per request, Command Vision excels at enterprise use cases including document analysis, chart interpretation, optical character recognition (OCR), and processing images featuring multiple languages. The model maintains the same API interface as other Command models, making it easy to integrate vision capabilities into existing applications.

## What Can Command A Vision be Used For?
Command A Vision is excellent in enterprise use cases such as:

- Analysis of charts, graphs, and diagrams;
- Extracting and understanding in-image tables;
- Document optical character recognition (OCR) and question answering;
- Natural-language image processing.

## Limitations
Be aware that [tool use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tools) isn't supported with this model.

Also, it's important to mention that Command A Vision can accept images as input, but doesn't generate them.

For more detailed breakdowns of these and other applications, check out [our cookbooks](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/tree/main/notebooks/guides/vision).
