Cohere [has first class support for LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/cohere), a framework which enables you to quickly create LLM powered applications. This doc will guide you through how to leverage different Cohere features with LangChain. 

### Prerequisite

To use LangChain and Cohere you will need: 

- LangChain package. To install it, run `pip install langchain`. 

- LangChain Package. To install it, run:
    - `pip install langchain`
    - `pip install langchain-cohere` (to use the Cohere integrations in LangChain)
    - Optional: `pip install langchain-community` (to access third-party integrations such as web search APIs)
- Cohere's SDK. To install it, run `pip install cohere`. If you run into any issues or want more details on Cohere's SDK, [see this wiki](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python).
- A Cohere API Key. For more details on pricing [see this page](https://cohere.com/pricing). When you create an account with Cohere, we automatically create a trial API key for you. This key will be available on the dashboard where you can copy it, and it's in the dashboard section called "API Keys" as well.
