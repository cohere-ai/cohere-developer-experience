[Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query. Integrated machine-learned model inference allows you to apply AI to make sense of your data in real time.

Check out [this post](https://blog.vespa.ai/scaling-large-vector-datasets-with-cohere-binary-embeddings-and-vespa/) to find more information about working with Cohere's embeddings on Vespa.
