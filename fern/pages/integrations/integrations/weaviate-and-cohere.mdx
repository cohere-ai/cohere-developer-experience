[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) is an open source vector search engine that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering. Here, we'll create a Weaviate Cluster to index your data with Cohere Embed, and process it with Rerank and Command. 

Here are the steps involved:
- Create the Weaviate cluster (see [this post](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart) for more detail.)
- Once the cluster is created, you will receive the cluster URL and API key.
- Use the provided URL and API key to connect to your Weaviate cluster.
- Use the Weaviate Python client to create your collection to store data

## Getting Set up
First, let's handle the imports, the URLs, and the pip installs.

```python PYTHON
from google.colab import userdata

weaviate_url = userdata.get("WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT")
weaviate_key = userdata.get("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")
cohere_key = userdata.get("COHERE_API_KEY")
```

```python PYTHON
!pip install -U weaviate-client -q
```

```python PYTHON
# Import the weaviate modules to interact with the Weaviate vector database
import weaviate
from weaviate.classes.init import Auth

# Define headers for the API requests, including the Cohere API key
headers = {
    "X-Cohere-Api-Key": cohere_key,
}

# Connect to the Weaviate cloud instance
client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
    cluster_url=weaviate_url,  # `weaviate_url`: your Weaviate URL
    auth_credentials=Auth.api_key(
        weaviate_key
    ),  # `weaviate_key`: your Weaviate API key
    headers=headers,
)
```

## Embed
Now, we'll create a new collection named `"Healthcare_Compliance"` in the Weaviate database.

```python PYTHON
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure

# This is where the "Healthcare_Compliance" collection is created in Weaviate.
client.collections.create(
    "Healthcare_Compliance",
    vectorizer_config=[
        # Configure a named vectorizer using Cohere's  model
        Configure.NamedVectors.text2vec_cohere(
            name="title_vector",  # Name of the vectorizer
            source_properties=[
                "title"
            ],  # Property to vectorize (in this case, the "title" field)
            model="embed-english-v3.0",  # Cohere model to use for vectorization
        )
    ],
)
```

You'll see something like this:
```
<weaviate.collections.collection.sync.Collection at 0x7f48a5604590>
```

Next, we'll define the list of healthcare compliance documents, retrieve the `"Healthcare_Compliance"` collection from the Weaviate client, and use a dynamic batch process to add multiple documents to the collection efficiently.

```python PYTHON
# Define the list of healthcare compliance documents

hl_compliance_docs = [
    {
        "title": "HIPAA Compliance Guide",
        "description": "Comprehensive overview of HIPAA regulations, including patient privacy rules, data security standards, and breach notification requirements.",
    },
    {
        "title": "FDA Drug Approval Process",
        "description": "Detailed explanation of the FDA's drug approval process, covering clinical trials, safety reviews, and post-market surveillance.",

    },
    {
        "title": "Medicare and Medicaid Billing",
        "description": "Guide to billing and reimbursement processes for Medicare and Medicaid, including coding, claims submission, and audit compliance.",

    {
        "title": "Patient Rights and Consent",
        "description": "Overview of patient rights under federal and state laws, including informed consent, access to medical records, and end-of-life decisions.",

    },
    {

        "description": "Guidelines for ensuring workplace safety in healthcare settings, including infection control, hazard communication, and emergency preparedness.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Health Insurance Portability",
        "description": "Discussion of COBRA and other laws ensuring continuity of health insurance coverage during job transitions or life events.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Medical Device Regulations",
        "description": "Overview of FDA regulations for medical devices, including classification, premarket approval, and post-market surveillance.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) Standards",
        "description": "Explanation of standards and regulations for EHR systems, including interoperability, data exchange, and patient privacy.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Pharmacy Regulations",
        "description": "Overview of state and federal regulations governing pharmacy practices, including prescription drug monitoring, compounding, and controlled substances.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Mental Health Parity Act",
        "description": "Analysis of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, ensuring equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorder treatment.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Healthcare Quality Reporting",
        "description": "Guide to quality reporting requirements for healthcare providers, including measures, submission processes, and performance benchmarks.",
    },
    {
        "title": "Advance Directives and End-of-Life Care",
        "description": "Overview of laws and regulations governing advance directives, living wills, and end-of-life care decisions.",
    },
]

# Retrieve the "Healthcare_Compliance" collection from the Weaviate client
collection = client.collections.get("Healthcare_Compliance")

# Use a dynamic batch process to add multiple documents to the collection efficiently
with collection.batch.dynamic() as batch:
    for src_obj in hl_compliance_docs:
        # Add each document to the batch, specifying the "title" and "description" properties
        batch.add_object(
            properties={
                "title": src_obj["title"],
                "description": src_obj["description"],
            },
        )
```

Now, we'll iterate over the objects we've retrieved and print their results:

```python PYTHON
# Import the MetadataQuery class from weaviate.classes.query to handle metadata in queries
from weaviate.classes.query import MetadataQuery

# Retrieve the "Healthcare_Compliance" collection from the Weaviate client
collection = client.collections.get("Healthcare_Compliance")

# Perform a near_text search for documents related to "policies related to drug compounding"
response = collection.query.near_text(
    query="policies related to drug compounding",  # Search query
    limit=2,  # Limit the number of results to 2
    return_metadata=MetadataQuery(
        distance=True
    ),  # Include distance metadata in the results
)

# Iterate over the retrieved objects and print their details
for obj in response.objects:
    title = obj.properties.get("title")
    description = obj.properties.get("description")
    distance = (
        obj.metadata.distance
    )  # Get the distance metadata (A lower value for a distance means that two vectors are closer to one another than a higher value)
    print(f"Title: {title}")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
    print(f"Distance: {distance}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

The output will look something like this (NOTE: a lower value for a `Distance` means that two vectors are closer to one another than those with a higher value):

```
Title: Pharmacy Regulations
Description: Overview of state and federal regulations governing pharmacy practices, including prescription drug monitoring, compounding, and controlled substances.
Distance: 0.5904817581176758
--------------------------------------------------
Title: FDA Drug Approval Process
Description: Detailed explanation of the FDA's drug approval process, covering clinical trials, safety reviews, and post-market surveillance.
Distance: 0.6262975931167603
--------------------------------------------------
```

## Embed + Rerank
Now, we'll add in Cohere Rerank to surface more relevant results. This will involve some more set up:
```python PYTHON
# Import the weaviate module to interact with the Weaviate vector database
import weaviate
from weaviate.classes.init import Auth

# Define headers for the API requests, including the Cohere API key
headers = {
    "X-Cohere-Api-Key": cohere_key,
}

# Connect to the Weaviate cloud instance
client = weaviate.connect_to_weaviate_cloud(
    cluster_url=weaviate_url,  # `weaviate_url`: your Weaviate URL
    auth_credentials=Auth.api_key(
        weaviate_key
    ),  # `weaviate_key`: your Weaviate API key
    headers=headers,  # Include the Cohere API key in the headers
)
```

And here we'll create a `"Legal_Docs"` collection in the Weaviate database:
```python PYTHON
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, Property, DataType

# Create a new collection named "Legal_Docs" in the Weaviate database
client.collections.create(
    name="Legal_Docs",
    properties=[
        # Define a property named "title" with data type TEXT
        Property(name="title", data_type=DataType.TEXT),
    ],
    # Configure the vectorizer to use Cohere's text2vec model
    vectorizer_config=Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_cohere(
        model="embed-english-v3.0"  # Specify the Cohere model to use for vectorization
    ),
    # Configure the reranker to use Cohere's rerank model
    reranker_config=Configure.Reranker.cohere(
        model="rerank-english-v3.0"  # Specify the Cohere model to use for reranking
    ),
)
```
```python PYTHON

    },
]
```

```python PYTHON
# Retrieve the "Legal_Docs" collection from the Weaviate client
collection = client.collections.get("Legal_Docs")

# Use a dynamic batch process to add multiple documents to the collection efficiently
with collection.batch.dynamic() as batch:
    for src_obj in legal_documents:
        # Add each document to the batch, specifying the "title" and "description" properties
        batch.add_object(
            properties={
                "title": src_obj["title"],
                "description": src_obj["description"],
            },
        )
```

Now, we'll need to define a searh query:
```python PYTHON
search_query = "eligibility requirements for filing bankruptcy"
```

This code snippet imports the `MetadataQuery` class from `weaviate.classes.query` to handle metadata in queries, iterates over the retrieved objects, and prints their details:

```python PYTHON 
# Import the MetadataQuery class from weaviate.classes.query to handle metadata in queries
from weaviate.classes.query import MetadataQuery

# Retrieve the "Legal_Docs" collection from the Weaviate client
collection = client.collections.get("Legal_Docs")

# Perform a near_text semantic search for documents
response = collection.query.near_text(
    query=search_query,  # Search query
    limit=3,                  # Limit the number of results to 3
    return_metadata=MetadataQuery(distance=True)  # Include distance metadata in the results
)

print("Semantic Search")
print("*" * 50)

# Iterate over the retrieved objects and print their details
for obj in response.objects:
    title = obj.properties.get("title")
    description = obj.properties.get("description")
    metadata_distance = obj.metadata.distance
    print(f"Title: {title}")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
    print(f"Metadata Distance: {metadata_distance}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

The output will look something like this:
```

```

This code sets up Rerank infrastructure:
```python PYTHON
# Import the Rerank class from weaviate.classes.query to enable reranking in queries
from weaviate.classes.query import Rerank

# Perform a near_text search with reranking for documents related to "property contracts and zoning regulations"
rerank_response = collection.query.near_text(
    query=search_query,
    limit=3,
    rerank=Rerank(
        prop="description",  # Property to rerank based on (description in this case)
        query=search_query,  # Query to use for reranking
    ),
)

# Display the reranked search results
print("Reranked Search Results:")
for obj in rerank_response.objects:
    title = obj.properties.get("title")
    description = obj.properties.get("description")
    rerank_score = getattr(
        obj.metadata, "rerank_score", None
    )  # Get the rerank score metadata
    print(f"Title: {title}")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
    print(f"Rerank Score: {rerank_score}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

Here's what the output looks like:
```

Rerank Score: 6.4895394e-06
--------------------------------------------------
```

Based on the rerank scores, it's clear that the Bankruptcy Law Overview is the most relevant result, while the other two documents (Tax Law for Businesses and Consumer Protection Laws) have significantly lower scores, indicating they are less relevant to the query. Therefore, we should focus only on the most relevant result and can skip the other two.

## Embed + Rerank + Command
Finally, we'll add Command into the mix. This handles imports and creates a fresh `"Legal_Docs"` in the Weaviate database.

```python PYTHON
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure
from weaviate.classes.generate import GenerativeConfig

# Create a new collection named "Legal_Docs" in the Weaviate database
client.collections.create(
    name="Legal_Docs_RAG",
    properties=[
        # Define a property named "title" with data type TEXT
        Property(name="title", data_type=DataType.TEXT),
    ],
    # Configure the vectorizer to use Cohere's text2vec model
    vectorizer_config=Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_cohere(
        model="embed-english-v3.0"  # Specify the Cohere model to use for vectorization
    ),
    # Configure the reranker to use Cohere's rerank model
    reranker_config=Configure.Reranker.cohere(
        model="rerank-english-v3.0"  # Specify the Cohere model to use for reranking
    ),
    # Configure the generative model to use Cohere's command r plus model
    generative_config=Configure.Generative.cohere(
        model="command-r-plus"
    ),
)
```

You should see something like that:
```
<weaviate.collections.collection.sync.Collection at 0x7f48afc06410>
```

This retrieves `"Legal_Docs_RAG"` from Weaviate:

```python PYTHON
# Retrieve the "Legal_Docs_RAG" collection from the Weaviate client
collection = client.collections.get("Legal_Docs_RAG")

# Use a dynamic batch process to add multiple documents to the collection efficiently
with collection.batch.dynamic() as batch:
    for src_obj in legal_documents:
        # Add each document to the batch, specifying the "title" and "description" properties
        batch.add_object(
            properties={
                "title": src_obj["title"],
                "description": src_obj["description"],
            },
        )
```

As before, we'll iterate over the object and print the result:

```python PYTHON
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure
from weaviate.classes.generate import GenerativeConfig

# To generate text for each object in the search results, use the single prompt method.
# The example below generates outputs for each of the n search results, where n is specified by the limit parameter.

collection = client.collections.get("Legal_Docs_RAG")
response = collection.generate.near_text(
    query=search_query,
    limit=1,
    single_prompt="Translate this into French -  {title}: {description}",
)

for obj in response.objects:
    print("Retrieved results")
    print("-----------------")
    print(obj.properties["title"])
    print(obj.properties["description"])
    print("Generated output")
    print("-----------------")
    print(obj.generated)
```

You'll see something like this:

```

## Conclusion

This integration guide has demonstrated how to effectively combine Cohere's powerful AI capabilities with Weaviate's vector database to create sophisticated search and retrieval systems. We've covered three key approaches:

1. **Basic Vector Search**: Using Cohere's Embed model with Weaviate to perform semantic search, enabling natural language queries to find relevant documents based on meaning rather than just keywords.

2. **Enhanced Search with Rerank**: Adding Cohere's Rerank model to improve search results by reordering them based on relevance, ensuring the most pertinent documents appear first.

3. **Full RAG Pipeline**: Implementing a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines embedding, reranking, and Cohere's Command model to not only find relevant information but also generate contextual responses.

The integration showcases how these technologies work together to create more intelligent and accurate search systems. Whether you're building a healthcare compliance database, legal document system, or any other knowledge base, this combination provides a powerful foundation for semantic search and AI-powered content generation.

The flexibility of this integration allows you to adapt it to various use cases while maintaining high performance and accuracy in your search and retrieval operations.
