[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) is an open source vector search engine that stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering.

The `text2vec-cohere` module allows you to use [Cohere embeddings](/docs/embeddings) directly in the Weaviate vector search engine as a vectorization module. You can find more information on using Cohere's functionality on Weaviate [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere).
