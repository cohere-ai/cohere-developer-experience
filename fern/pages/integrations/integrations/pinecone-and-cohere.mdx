The [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) vector database makes it easy to build high-performance vector search applications. Use Cohere to generate language embeddings, then store them in Pinecone and use them for Semantic Search.

You can learn more by following this [step-by-step guide](https://docs.pinecone.io/integrations/cohere).
