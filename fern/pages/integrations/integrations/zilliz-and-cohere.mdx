[Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud) is a cloud-native vector database that stores, indexes, and searches for billions of embedding vectors to power enterprise-grade similarity search, recommender systems, anomaly detection, and more. Zilliz Cloud provides a fully-managed Milvus service, made by the creators of Milvus that allows for easy integration with vectorizers from Cohere and other popular models. Purpose-built to solve the challenge of managing billions of embeddings, Zilliz Cloud makes it easy to build applications for scale.

The following [guide](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/question-answering-using-zilliz-cloud-and-cohere) walks through how to integrate [Cohere embeddings](/docs/embeddings) with Zilliz.
