[Milvus](https://milvus.io/) is a highly flexible, reliable, and blazing-fast cloud-native, open-source vector database. It powers embedding similarity search and AI applications and strives to make vector databases accessible to every organization. Milvus is a graduated-stage project of the LF AI & Data Foundation.

The following [guide](https://milvus.io/docs/integrate_with_cohere.md) walks through how to integrate [Cohere embeddings](/docs/embeddings) with Milvus.
