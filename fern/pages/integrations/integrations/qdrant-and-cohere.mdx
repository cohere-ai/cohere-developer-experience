[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is an open-source vector similarity search engine and vector database. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.

Qdrant is written in Rust, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load.
