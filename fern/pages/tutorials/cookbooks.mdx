In order to help developers get up and running on using Cohere's functionality, we've put together [some cookbooks](/page/cookbooks) that work through common use cases.

They're organized by categories like "Agents," "Cloud," and "Summarization" to allow you to quickly find what you're looking for. To jump to a particular use-case category, click one of the links below:

- [Agents](/page/cookbooks#agents)
- [Open Source Software Integrations](/page/cookbooks#oss)
- [Search and Embeddings](/page/cookbooks#search)
- [Cloud](/page/cookbooks#cloud)
- [RAG](/page/cookbooks#rag)
- [Summarization](/page/cookbooks#summarization)

Here are some of the ones we think are most exciting!
