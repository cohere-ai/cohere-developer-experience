[Open in GitHub](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/guides/cohere-on-azure/azure-ai-text-generation.ipynb)

In this tutorial, we'll explore text generation using Cohere's Command model on Azure AI Foundry.

Text generation is a fundamental capability that enables LLMs systems to generate text for various applications, such as providing detailed responses to questions, helping with writing and editing tasks, creating conversational responses, and assisting with code generation and documentation.

In this tutorial, we'll cover:
- Setting up the Cohere client
- Basic text generation
- Other typical use cases
- Building a chatbot

We'll use Cohere's Command model deployed on Azure to demonstrate these capabilities and help you understand how to effectively use text generation in your applications.

## Setup

First, you will need to deploy the Command model on Azure via Azure AI Foundry. The deployment will create a serverless API with pay-as-you-go token based billing. You can find more information on how to deploy models in the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-serverless?tabs=azure-ai-studio).

In the example below, we are deploying the Command R+ (August 2024) model.

Once the model is deployed, you can access it via Cohere's Python SDK. Let's now install the Cohere SDK and set up our client.

To create a client, you need to provide the API key and the model's base URL for the Azure endpoint. You can get these information from the Azure AI Foundry platform where you deployed the model.


```python PYTHON
# ! pip install cohere

import cohere

co = cohere.Client(
  api_key="AZURE_API_KEY_CHAT",
  base_url="AZURE_ENDPOINT_CHAT" # example: "https://cohere-command-r-plus-08-2024-xyz.eastus.models.ai.azure.com/"
)
```

## Creating some contextual information

Before we begin, let's create some context to use in our text generation tasks. In this example, we'll use a set of technical support frequently asked questions (FAQs) as our context.


```python PYTHON
# Technical support FAQ
faq_tech_support = """- Question: How do I set up my new smartphone with my mobile plan?
- Answer:
  - Insert your SIM card into the device.

  - Contact customer support if the issue persists."""
```

## Helper function to generate text

Now, let's define a function to generate text using the Command R+ model on Bedrock. We’ll use this function a few times throughout.

This function takes a user message and generates the response via the chat endpoint. Note that we don't need to specify the model as we have already set it up in the client.

```python PYTHON
def generate_text(message):
    response = co.chat(
        message=message
    )
    return response
```

## Text generation

Let's explore basic text generation as our first use case. The model takes a prompt as input and produces a relevant response as output.

Consider a scenario where a customer support agent uses an LLM to help draft responses to customer inquiries. The agent provides technical support FAQs as context along with the customer's question. The prompt is structured to include three components: the instruction, the context (FAQs), and the specific customer inquiry.

After passing this prompt to our `generate_text` function, we receive a response object. The actual generated text can be accessed through the `response.text` attribute.




```python PYTHON
inquiry = "I've noticed some fluctuations in my mobile network's performance recently. The connection seems stable most of the time, but every now and then, I experience brief periods of slow data speeds. It happens a few times a day and is quite inconvenient."

prompt = f"""Use the FAQs below to provide a concise response to this customer inquiry.

# Customer inquiry
{inquiry}

# FAQs
{faq_tech_support}"""

response = generate_text(prompt)

print(response.text)
```
``` mdx
It's quite common to experience occasional fluctuations in mobile network performance, and there are a few steps you can take to address this issue. 

First, check your signal strength and consider moving to a different location with better coverage. Sometimes, even a small change in position can make a difference. If you find that you're in an area with low signal strength, this could be the primary reason for the slow data speeds. 

Next, try restarting your device. A simple restart can often resolve temporary glitches and improve your connection. After restarting, ensure that your data plan is active and has enough data allocated for your usage. If you're close to reaching your data limit, this could also impact your speeds. 

If the issue persists, it might be worth checking for any network outages in your area. Occasionally, temporary network issues can cause intermittent slowdowns. Contact your mobile network's customer support to inquire about any known issues and to receive further guidance. 

Additionally, consider the age and condition of your device. Older devices or those with outdated software might struggle to maintain consistent data speeds. Ensuring your device is up-to-date and well-maintained can contribute to a better overall network experience. 

If the problem continues, you may want to explore the option of upgrading your data plan. Higher-tier plans often offer faster speeds and more reliable connections, especially during peak usage times. Contact your mobile provider to discuss the available options and find a plan that better suits your needs.
```

## Text summarization

Another type of use case is text summarization. Now, let's summarize the customer inquiry into a single sentence. We add an instruction to the prompt and then pass the inquiry to the prompt.


```python PYTHON
prompt=f"""Summarize this customer inquiry into one short sentence.

Inquiry: {inquiry}"""

response = generate_text(prompt)

print(response.text)
```
```mdx
A customer is experiencing intermittent slow data speeds on their mobile network several times a day.
```

## Text rewriting

Text rewriting is a powerful capability that allows us to adapt content for different purposes while preserving the core message. This involves transforming the style, tone, or format of text to better suit the target audience or medium.

Let's look at an example where we convert a customer support chat response into a formal email. We'll construct the prompt by first stating our goal to rewrite the text, then providing the original chat response as context.


```python PYTHON
prompt=f"""Rewrite this customer support agent response into an email format, ready to send to the customer.

If you're experiencing brief periods of slow data speeds or difficulty sending text messages and connecting to your mobile network, here are some troubleshooting steps you can follow:

1. Check your signal strength - Move to an area with better coverage.
2. Restart your device and try connecting again.
3. Ensure your account is active and not suspended.
4. Contact customer support for further assistance. (This can include updating your plan for better network performance.)

Did these steps help resolve the issue? Let me know if you need further assistance."""

response = generate_text(prompt)

print(response.text)

## Build a Chatbot

While our previous examples were single-turn interactions, the Chat endpoint enables us to create chatbots that maintain memory of past conversation turns. This capability allows developers to build conversational applications that preserve context throughout the dialogue.

Below, we implement a basic customer support chatbot that acts as a helpful service agent. We'll create a function called run_chatbot that handles the conversation flow and displays messages and events. The function can take an optional chat history parameter to maintain conversational context across multiple turns.

For this, we introduce a couple of additional parameters to the Chat endpoint:

- `preamble`: A preamble contains instructions to help steer a chatbot’s response toward specific characteristics, such as a persona, style, or format. Here, we are using a simple preamble: “You are a helpful customer support agent that assists customers of a mobile network service.”
- `chat_history`: We store the history of a conversation between a user and the chatbot as a list, append every new conversation turn, and pass this information to the next endpoint call.


```python PYTHON
# Define a preamble
preamble = """## Task and Context
You are a helpful customer support agent that assists customers of a mobile network service."""

# Run the chatbot
def run_chatbot(message, chat_history=None):
    if chat_history is None:
        chat_history = []
        
    response = co.chat(
        message=message,
        preamble=preamble,
        chat_history=chat_history
    )
    
    print(response.text)
    
    chat_history = response.chat_history
            
    return chat_history
```


```python PYTHON
chat_history = run_chatbot("Hi. I've noticed some fluctuations in my mobile network's performance recently.")
```
```mdx
