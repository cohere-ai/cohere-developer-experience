In this document, we'll go through the nuts-and-bolts of building a generative-AI agent with Cohere's multi-step tool use functionality and the Langchain framework.

## Building the Langchain ReAct Agent

Multi-step tool use with Cohere can be implemented using the [Langchain framework](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/cohere), which conveniently comes with many pre-defined tools. More specifically, we recommend using the [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) agent abstraction in Langchain, powered by `create_cohere_react_agent`. Let’s see how we can easily build an agent, using the multi-step tool use capabilities of Langchain and Cohere.

<Note title="Jupyter Notebook">  
 The example below is also available in [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/agents/Vanilla_Multi_Step_Tool_Use.ipynb) for convenience.
</Note>

First, we'll install the dependencies. (Note: the `!` is required for notebooks, but you must omit it if you're in the command line).

```python PYTHON
! pip install --quiet langchain langchain_cohere langchain_experimental
```

Second, we define some tools to equip your agent. Langchain comes out-of-the-box with [more than 50](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/tools/) predefined tools, including web search, a python interpreter, vector stores, and many others.

Below, we've included two code snippets, equipping the agent with the Web Search and Python interpreter tools, respectively.

#### Example: define the Web Search tool

```python PYTHON
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = #<your-api-key>

internet_search = TavilySearchResults()
internet_search.name = "internet_search"
internet_search.description = "Returns a list of relevant document snippets for a textual query retrieved from the internet."


from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class TavilySearchInput(BaseModel):
   query: str = Field(description="Query to search the internet with")
internet_search.args_schema = TavilySearchInput
```

#### Example: define the Python Interpreter tool

```python PYTHON
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL

python_repl = PythonREPL()
python_tool = Tool(
   name="python_repl",
   description="Executes python code and returns the result. The code runs in astatic sandbox without interactive mode, so print output or save output to a file.",
   func=python_repl.run,
)
python_tool.name = "python_interpreter"

# from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class ToolInput(BaseModel):
   code: str = Field(description="Python code to execute.")
python_tool.args_schema = ToolInput
```

Even better any Python function can easily be _transformed_ into a Langchain tool by using the `@tool` decorator. As a best practice, should specify the tool name, definition, and arguments schema.

#### Example: define a custom tool

```python PYTHON

from langchain_core.tools import tool
import random

@tool
def random_operation_tool(a: int, b: int):
 """Calculates a random operation between the inputs."""
 coin_toss = random.uniform(0, 1)
 if coin_toss > 0.5:
   return {'output': a*b}
 else:
   return {'output': a+b}

random_operation_tool.name = "random_operation" # use python case
random_operation_tool.description = "Calculates a random operation between the inputs."

from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
class random_operation_inputs(BaseModel):
   a: int = Field(description="First input")
   b: int = Field(description="Second input")
random_operation_tool.args_schema = random_operation_inputs


```

Third, create a ReAct agent in Langchain. The model can dynamically pick the right tool(s) for the user query, call them in a sequence, analyze the results, and self-reflect. Note that your ReAct agent can optionally take an input preamble.

```python PYTHON
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_cohere.react_multi_hop.agent import create_cohere_react_agent
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_cohere.chat_models import ChatCohere

# LLM
llm = ChatCohere(model="command-r-plus-08-2024", temperature=0.3)

# Preamble
preamble = """
You are an expert who answers the user's question with the most relevant datasource.
You are equipped with an internet search tool and a special vectorstore of information
about how to write good essays.
"""

# Prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("{input}")

# Create the ReAct agent
agent = create_cohere_react_agent(
   llm=llm,
   tools=[internet_search, vectorstore_search, python_tool],
   prompt=prompt,
)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent,
                               tools=[internet_search, vectorstore_search, python_tool],
                               verbose=True)


```

Finally, call your agent with a question!

```python PYTHON
agent_executor.invoke({
   "input": "I want to write an essay about the Roman Empire. Any tips for writing an essay? Any fun facts?",
   "preamble": preamble,
})
```

### Inspecting the Logs

We can get some insight into what's going on under the hood by taking a look at the logs (we've added `#` comments throughout for context):

```razor ASP.NET
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


# Here is the model plan
I will search for tips on writing an essay and fun facts about the Roman Empire.

 
# The model decides to use a first tool: the vector store
{'tool_name': 'vectorstore_search', 'parameters': {'query': 'tips for writing an essay'}}

# Here are the results from the vector store call: retrieved passages
I should have asked how do you write essays well? Though
these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. [ … more of retrieved snippet 1 … ]

didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you
need [ … more of retrieved snippet 2 … ]

You don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's
no excuse for not getting it right eventually, because [ more of retrieved snippet 3 … ]

### Some Useful Tools

Beyond the web search tool and the Python interpreter tool shared in the code snippets above, we have found some tools to be particularly useful. Here's an example of leveraging a vector store for greater functionality:

```python PYTHON
# You can easily equip your agent with a vector store!

from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_cohere import CohereEmbeddings

# Set embeddings
embd = CohereEmbeddings()

# Docs to index
urls = [
   "https://paulgraham.com/best.html",
]

# Load
docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]
docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]

# Split
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
   chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=0
)
doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

# Add to vectorstore
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(
   documents=doc_splits,
   embedding=embd,
)

vectorstore_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()


from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool

vectorstore_search = create_retriever_tool(
   retriever=vectorstore_retriever,
   name="vectorstore_search",
   description="Retrieve relevant info from a vectorstore that contains information from Paul Graham about how to write good essays."
)
```

### Multi-turn Conversations and Chat History

So far, we asked one-off questions to the ReAct agent. In many enterprise applications, end users want to have conversations with the ReAct agent. 

The ReAct agent can handle multi-turn conversations by using `chat_history`.

```python PYTHON
# Step 1: Construct the chat history as a list of LangChain Messages, ending with the last user message
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage

chat_history = [
   HumanMessage(content="I'm considering switching to Oracle for my CRM."),
   AIMessage(content="That sounds like a good idea! How can I help you?"),
   HumanMessage(content="Recap all the info you can find about their offering."),
]

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(chat_history)

# Step 2: When you make the agent, specify the chat_history as the prompt
agent = create_cohere_react_agent(
   llm=llm,
   tools=[internet_search, vectorstore_search, python_tool],
   prompt=prompt,
)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent,
                               tools=[internet_search, vectorstore_search, python_tool],
                               verbose=True)

# Step 3: When you invoke the agent_executor there's no need to pass anything else into invoke
response = agent_executor.invoke({
   "preamble": preamble,
})

response['output']
```

### Can the ReAct Agent Directly Answer a Question?

Yes. The ReAct agent from Cohere comes out of the box with the ability to answer a user question directly. This happens when answering the user's question doesn’t require using a tool. 

For example, let’s look at the following question:

```python PYTHON
agent_executor.invoke({
   "input": "Hey how are you?",
})
```

By inspecting the logs, we see that the ReAct agent decided to just respond directly.

````asp
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Plan: I will respond to the user's greeting.
Action: ```json JSON
[
    {
        "tool_name": "directly_answer",
        "parameters": {}
    }
]
```
Answer: Hey, I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you today?
Grounded answer: Hey, I'm doing well, thank you for asking! How can I help you today?

> Finished chain.

 'intermediate_steps': []}
````
