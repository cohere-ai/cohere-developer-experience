Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method for generating text using additional information fetched from an external data source, which can greatly increase the accuracy of the response. When used in conjunction with a [Command](/docs/command-beta), [Command R](/docs/command-r), or [Command R+](/docs/command-r-plus), the [Chat API](/reference/chat) makes it easy to generate text that is grounded on supplementary information.

The code snippet below, for example, will produce a grounded answer to `"Where do the tallest penguins live?"`, along with inline citations based on the provided documents.

**Request**

```python PYTHON
import cohere
co = cohere.Client(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

co.chat(
  model="command-r-plus",
  message="Where do the tallest penguins live?",
  documents=[
    {"title": "Tall penguins", "snippet": "Emperor penguins are the tallest."},
    {"title": "Penguin habitats", "snippet": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica."},
    {"title": "What are animals?", "snippet": "Animals are different from plants."}
  ])
```

**Response**

```json JSON
{
  "text": "The tallest penguins, Emperor penguins, live in Antarctica.",  
  "citations": [  
    {"start": 22, "end": 38, "text": "Emperor penguins", "document_ids": ["doc_0"]},  
    {"start": 48, "end": 59, "text": "Antarctica.", "document_ids": ["doc_1"]}  
  ],  
  "documents": [  
    {"id": "doc_0", "title": "Tall penguins", "snippet": "Emperor penguins are the tallest.", "url": ""},  
    {"id": "doc_1", "title": "Penguin habitats", "snippet": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica.", "url": ""}  
  ] 
}
```

The resulting generation is`"The tallest penguins, Emperor penguins, live in Antarctica"`. The model was able to combine partial information from multiple sources and ignore irrelevant documents to arrive at the full answer.

Nice :penguin:❄️!

The response also includes **inline citations**  that reference the first two documents, since they hold the answers.

As you will learn in the following section, the [Chat API](/reference/chat) will also assist you with generating search queries to fetch documents from a data source.

You can find more code and context in [this colab notebook](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Vanilla_RAG.ipynb).

### Three steps of RAG

The RAG workflow generally consists of **3 steps**:

- **Generating search queries** for finding relevant documents. _What does the model recommend looking up before answering this question?_
- **Fetching relevant documents** from an external data source using the generated search queries. _Performing a search to find some relevant information._
- **Generating a response** with inline citations using the fetched documents. _Using the acquired knowledge to produce an educated answer_.

#### Example: Using RAG to identify the definitive 90s boy band

In this section, we will use the three step RAG workflow to finally settle the score between the notorious boy bands Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. We ask the model to provide an informed answer to the question `"Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?"`

#### Step 1: Generating search queries

Calling the [Chat API](/reference/chat) with the `search_queries_only` parameter set to `True` will return a list of **search queries**. In the example below, we ask the model to suggest some search queries that would be useful when answering the question.

**Request**

```python PYTHON
import cohere
co = cohere.Client(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

co.chat(
  model="command-r-plus",
  message="Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?",
  search_queries_only=True
)
```

**Response**

```json JSON
{
  "is_search_required": true,
  "search_queries": [
    {"text": "Nsync popularity", "generation_id": "b560dd68-743e-4c32-98a2-a9b7e3e96861"},
    {"text": "Backstreet Boys popularity", "generation_id": "b560dd68-743e-4c32-98a2-a9b7e3e96861"}
  ]
}
```

Indeed, to generate a factually accurate answer to the question `"Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?"`, looking up `Nsync popularity` and `Backstreet Boys popularity` first would be helpful.

#### Step 2: Fetching relevant documents

The next step is to [fetch documents](/docs/documents-and-citations) from the relevant data source using the generated search queries. For example, to answer the question about the two pop sensations _NSYNC_ and _Backstreet Boys_, one might want to use an API from a web search engine, and fetch the contents of the websites listed at the top of the search results.

We won't go into details of fetching data in this guide, since it's very specific to the search API you're querying. However we should mention that breaking up long documents into smaller ones first (1-2 paragraphs) will help you not go over the context limit. When trying to stay within the context length limit, you might need to omit some of the documents from the request. To make sure that only the least relevant documents are omitted, we recommend using the [Rerank endpoint](/reference/rerank) endpoint which will sort the documents by relevancy to the query. The lowest ranked documents are the ones you should consider dropping first.

#### Step 3: Generating a response

In the final step, we will be calling the Chat API again, but this time passing along the `documents` you acquired in Step 2. A `document` object is a dictionary containing the content and the metadata of the text. We recommend using a few descriptive keys such as `"title"`, `"snippet"`, or `"last updated"` and only including semantically relevant data. The keys and the values will be formatted into the prompt and passed to the model.

**Request**

```

co = cohere.Client(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

If you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, the next page explains it with a short video. I fully recommend watching the video before getting into the sales figures."

Not only will we discover that the Backstreet Boys were the more popular band, but the model can also _Tell Me Why_, by providing details [supported by citations](/docs/documents-and-citations).

### Connectors

As an alternative to manually implementing the 3 step workflow, the Chat API offers a 1-line solution for RAG using [Connectors](/docs/overview-rag-connectors). In the example below, specifying the `web-search` connector will generate search queries, use them to conduct an internet search and use the results to inform the model and produce an answer.

**Request**

```python PYTHON
import cohere
co = cohere.Client(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

co.chat(
  model="command-r-plus",
  message="Who is more popular: Nsync or Backstreet Boys?",
  connectors=[{"id": "web-search"}])
```

**Response**

In addition to the Cohere provided `web-search` Connector, you can [register your own custom Connectors](/docs/creating-and-deploying-a-connector) such as Google Drive, Confluence etc.

### Prompt Truncation

LLMs come with limitations; specifically, they can only handle so much text as input. This means that you will often need to figure out which document sections and chat history elements to keep, and which ones to omit.

For more information, check out our dedicated doc on [prompt truncation](/docs/prompt-truncation).

### Caveats

It’s worth underscoring that RAG does not guarantee accuracy. It involves giving a model context which informs its replies, but if the provided documents are themselves out-of-date, inaccurate, or biased, whatever the model generates might be as well. What’s more, RAG doesn’t guarantee that a model won’t hallucinate. It greatly reduces the risk, but doesn’t necessarily eliminate it altogether. This is why we put an emphasis on including inline citations, which allow users to verify the information.
