As the name implies, Connectors are ways of connecting to data sources. They enable you to combine Cohere large language models (LLMs), which power the [Chat API endpoint](/reference/chat), with data sources such as internal documents, document databases, the broader internet, or any other source of context which can inform the replies generated by the model.

Connectors enhance Cohere [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) offering and can respond to user questions and prompts with substantive, grounded generations that contain citations to external public or private knowledge bases. To see an example of grounded generations with citations, try out [the Cohere dashboard](https://coral.cohere.com/) after enabling web search grounding. 

The following graphic demonstrates the flow of information when using a connector:

## Using Connectors to Create Grounded Generations

Connectors are specified when calling the Chat endpoint, which you can read more about [here](/docs/chat-api#connectors-mode). An example request specifying the managed web-search connector would look like this:

<CodeBlocks>
```python PYTHON
import cohere  
co = cohere.Client(api_key='Your API key')

response = co.chat(
  model="command-r-plus-08-2024"
	message="What is the chemical formula for glucose?",  
	connectors=[{"id": "web-search"}]  
)
```
```curl CURL
curl --location 'https://production.api.cohere.ai/v1/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {Your API key}' \
--data '
{
    "message": "What is the chemical formula for glucose?",
    "connectors": [{"id": "web-search"}]
}
```
```typescript TYPESCRIPT
import { CohereClient } from "cohere-ai";
const cohere = new CohereClient({
    token: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
(async () => {
    const response = await cohere.chat({
      message:"What is the chemical formula for glucose?",  
			connectors:[{"id": "web-search"}],  
    });
    console.log("Received response", response);
})();
```
```go GO
import (
  cohere       "github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-go/v2"
  cohereclient "github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-go/v2/client"
)
client := cohereclient.NewClient(cohereclient.WithToken("<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>"))
response, err := client.Chat(
  context.TODO(),
  &cohere.ChatRequest{
    Message: "What is the chemical formula for glucose?",
	  Connectors:[]*cohereclient.ChatConnector{{Id: "web-search"}},  
)
```
</CodeBlocks>

If you or an administrator at your organization has created a new connector, you can add this connector id to the list. Here’s an example:

```python PYTHON
connectors=[{"id": "web-search"}, {"id": "customer-connector-id"}].
```

The response will then contain the generated text with citation elements that link to the documents returned from the connector. For example, the formula `C6H12O6` below has a citation element that links to three websites.

Glucose is an aldohexose.\n\nIs glucose a reducing sugar?\n\nGlucose is a reducing sugar because it belongs to the category of an aldose meaning its open-chain form contains an aldehyde group. Generally, an aldehyde is quite easily oxidized to carboxylic acids.\n\nWhat are the 5 reducing sugars?\n\nThe 5 reducing sugars are ribose, glucose, galactose, glyceraldehyde, xylose.\n\nWhat are the elements of glucose?",

## A Caveat on Deploying Connectors

Connector registration only works _natively_ on the Cohere platform. You can, however, register a connector for e.g. Azure or another platform using the [Cohere toolkit](/docs/coral-toolkit) (more technical detail is available [here](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit/?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-add-a-connector-to-the-toolkit).) You might also find it useful to read about Cohere deployments on [Amazon](/docs/cohere-on-aws), [Azure](/docs/cohere-on-microsoft-azure), and [single-container cloud environments](/docs/single-container-on-private-clouds).
