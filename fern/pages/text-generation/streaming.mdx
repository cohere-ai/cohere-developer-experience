The [Chat API](/reference/chat) is capable of streaming events (such as text generation) as they come. This means that partial results from the model can be displayed within moments, even if the full generation takes longer.

You're likely already familiar with streaming. When you ask the model a question using the [Coral](https://coral.cohere.com/) UI, the interface doesn't output a single block of text, instead it _streams_ the text out a few words at a time. In many user interfaces enabling streaming improves the user experience by lowering the perceived latency.

## Example

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.Client(api_key='<YOUR API KEY>')

for event in co.chat_stream(message="What is an LLM?"):
    if event.event_type == "text-generation":
      print(event.text)
    elif event.event_type == "stream-end":
      print(event.finish_reason)
```

## Stream Events

When streaming is enabled, the API sends events down one by one. Each event has an **event_type**. Events of different types need to be handled correctly.

### Basic Stream Events

#### stream-start

The first event in the stream contains metadata for the request such as the `generation_id`. Only one `stream-start` event will be emitted.

#### stream-end

A `stream-end` event is the final event of the stream, and is returned only when streaming is finished. This event contains aggregated data from all the other events such as the complete `text`, as well as a `finish_reason` for why the stream ended (i.e. because of it was finished or there was an error). 

Only one `stream-end` event will be returned.

#### text-generation

A `text-generation` event is emitted whenever the next chunk of text comes back from the model. As the model continues generating text, multiple events of this type will be emitted. 

### Retrieval Augmented Generation Stream Events

These events are generated when using the API with various [RAG](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) parameters.

#### search-queries-generation

Emitted when search queries are generated by the model. Only happens when the Chat API is used with the `search_queries_only` or `connectors` parameters .

#### search-results

Emitted when the specified `connectors` respond with search results. Only one event of this type will be returned for a given stream. 

#### citation-generation

This event contains streamed citations and references to the documents being cited (if citations have been generated by the model). Multiple `citation-generation` events will be returned.

For an illustration of a generated citation with document-specific indices, look at the "Example Response" below. As you can see, each `document` has an `id`, and when that document is used as part of the response, it's cited by that id. 

### Tool Use Stream Events

#### tool-calls-chunk

Emitted when the next token of the tool plan or the tool call is generated.

```json JSON
...
{
    "is_finished": false,
    "event_type": "tool-calls-chunk",
    "text": "I"
}
{
    "is_finished": false,
    "event_type": "tool-calls-chunk",
    "text": " will"
}
{
    "is_finished": false,
    "event_type": "tool-calls-chunk",
    "text": " use"
}
...
{
    "is_finished": false,
    "event_type": "tool-calls-chunk",
    "tool_call_delta": {
      	"index": 0,
        "name": "reverse_string"
    }
}
{
    "is_finished": false,
    "event_type": "tool-calls-chunk",
    "tool_call_delta": {
        "index": ,
        "parameters": "{\n            \""
    }
}
...
```

#### tool-calls-generation

Emitted when the model generates tool calls that require actioning upon. The event contains a list of `tool_calls`.

```
{
    "is_finished": false,
    "event_type": "tool-calls-generation",
    "text": "I will use the reverse_string tool twice, once for each of the words provided, to find the answers.",
    "tool_calls": [
        {
            "name": "reverse_string",
            "parameters": {
                "s": "hello"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "reverse_string",
            "parameters": {
                "s": "goodbye"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

It contains information about whether the streaming session is finished, what type of event is being fired, and the text that was generated by the model. 

Of course, the `print(event.text)` and `print(event.finish_reason)` lines in the code snippet above peels a lot of the extra information away, so what your output would look more like this:

```
The
 tallest
 living
 penguins
 in
 the
 world
 are
 Emperor
 penguins
,
 which
 can
 reach
 heights
 of
 approximately
 115
 cm
 (
45
.
3
 inches
)
 tall
.
 Interestingly
,
 they
 are
 only
 found
 in
 Antarctica
.
[{'start': 45, 'end': 61, 'text': 'Emperor penguins', 'document_ids': ['doc_0']}]
[{'start': 104, 'end': 130, 'text': '115 cm (45.3 inches) tall.', 'document_ids': ['doc_0']}]
[{'start': 169, 'end': 180, 'text': 'Antarctica.', 'document_ids': ['doc_1']}]
COMPLETE
```

It should be (more or less) the same text, but that text is on its own rather than being accompanied by search queries, event types, etc. 

Note that the citation objects in the response are returned as part of a RAG request, which you can learn more about in the [Retrieval Augmented Generation guide](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)

When the model has finished generating, it returns the full text, some metadata, citations, and the documents that were used to ground the reply.
