```
On March 1st, 2024, it was announced that Cohere has opened a New York office as part of
an expansion plan. The company, a Canadian AI startup, plans to employ around 30 people
in the office, located in the Meatpacking District.


The primary reason for the move is to tap into the talent pool in the city and to support
work with enterprise AI adoptions, including customers like McKinsey.


Cohere also had news in January 2024 that it was in discussion with investors regarding
raising capital of roughly $500 million to $1 billion. This would follow the frenzied
investment ignited by AI software applications.
