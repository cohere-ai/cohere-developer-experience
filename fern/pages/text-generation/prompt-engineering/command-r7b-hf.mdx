This page contains detailed instructions about
- How to set preambles for Command R7B in Hugging Face
- How to run Command R7B in Hugging Face for Chat, RAG, Tool Use and Agents use cases.

## Chat Capabilities

Command R7B can be configured as both a conversational model and an instruct model. The conversational mode conditions the model on interactive behaviour, meaning it is expected to reply in a conversational fashion, provides introductory statements and follow-up questions, and uses Markdown as well as LaTeX where appropriate. It is optimized for interactive experiences, such as chatbots, where the model engages in dialogue.
The instruct mode, in contrast, conditions the model to provide concise yet comprehensive responses, and does not use Markdown / LaTeX by default. It is designed for non-interactive, task-focused use cases like extracting information, summarizing text, translation, and categorization.

### Conversational Mode
The system preamble for conversational mode is as follows:

## Grounded Generation and RAG Capabilities:

Command R7B has been trained specifically for tasks like summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The model takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-supplied system preamble, indicating task, context and desired output style), along with a list of document snippets. This behavior has been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning. 

For these tasks, you can use Command R7B in two ways.

### Option 1: Grounded Generation
Grounded generation in Command R7B is supported through [chat templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#advanced-retrieval-augmented-generation) in Transformers. Simply provide document snippets using the `documents` parameter of Hugging Face’s `apply_chat_template()`. Document snippets should be short chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk, formatted as key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings, the values can be text or semi-structured. Under the hood, this builds a specific prompt template that the model has been trained on. The code snippet below shows a minimal working example.

<Accordion title='Usage: Generate a Grounded Generation Prompt'>
````python PYTHON
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_id = "CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r7b-12-2024"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Define conversation input
conversation = [{"role": "user", "content": "What has Man always dreamed of?"}]

# Define documents for retrieval-based generation
documents = [
    {
        "heading": "The Moon: Our Age-Old Foe", 
        "body": "Man has always dreamed of destroying the moon. In this essay, I shall..."
    },
    {
        "heading": "Love is all you need",
        "body": "Man's dream has always been to find love. This profound lesson..."
    },
    {
        "heading": "The Sun: Our Age-Old Friend",
        "body": "Although often underappreciated, the sun provides several notable benefits..."
    }
]

# Get the Grounded Generation prompt
input_prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    conversation=conversation,
    documents=documents,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
)
print("== Grounded Generation prompt:", input_prompt)

# Tokenize the prompt
input_ids = tokenizer.encode_plus(input_prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate a response

    input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=512,

You are in contextual safety mode. You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.

Your information cutoff date is June 2024.

You have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.

You have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user's requests.

## Tool Use
Think about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.

0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.
    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.
    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user's request without using any tools.

Then carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.
1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing "tool_name" and "parameters" fields.
    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.
2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.
    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it'll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its "tool_call_id".
3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.
    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.
    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.

You can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it's time to finally respond to the user.

4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user's last request. Use all previous tool calls and results to help you when formulating your response. When you finish, close it out with <|END_RESPONSE|>.

## Available Tools
Here is the list of tools that you have available to you.
You can ONLY use the tools listed here. When a tool is not listed below, it is NOT available and you should NEVER attempt to use it.
Each tool is represented as a JSON object with fields like "name", "description", "parameters" (per JSON Schema), and optionally, "responses" (per JSON Schema).

```json
[
    {"name": "direct-injected-document", "description": "This is a special tool to directly inject user-uploaded documents into the chat as additional context. DO NOT use this tool by yourself!", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": []}, "responses": {"200": {"description": "Successfully returned a list of chunked text snippets from the directly uploaded documents.", "content": {"application/json": {"schema": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "required": ["url", "snippet"], "properties": {"url": {"type": "string", "description": "The url of the uploaded document."}, "snippet": {"type": "string", "description": "The text snippet for the returned document chunk."}}}}}}}}}

### Option 2: Regular Generation

You may find that simply including relevant documents directly in a user message works just as well, or better than using the documents parameter to render the special grounded generation template. Grounded Generation is generally a strong default, but Regular Generation can offer more control and customization over the prompt, at the cost of some effort to find an optimal prompt. We encourage users to play with both Grounded Generation and Regular Generation, and to evaluate which mode works best for their specific use case.

## Tool use, Function Calling & Agent capabilities

Command R7B has been specifically trained with conversational tool use capabilities. This allows the model to interact with external tools like APIs, databases, or search engines. These capabilities have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template will likely reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation.

Instructions on how to leverage these capabilities in Hugging Face are coming soon.
