This page contains detailed instructions about
- How to set system instructions for Command R7B in Hugging Face
- How to run Command R7B in Hugging Face for Chat, RAG, Tool Use and Agents use cases.

## Chat Capabilities

Command R7B can be configured as both a conversational model and an instruct model.
- The conversational mode conditions the model on interactive behaviour, meaning it is expected to reply in a conversational fashion, provides introductory statements and follow-up questions, and uses Markdown as well as LaTeX where appropriate. It is optimized for interactive experiences, such as chatbots, where the model engages in dialogue.
- The instruct mode, in contrast, conditions the model to provide concise yet comprehensive responses, and does not use Markdown / LaTeX by default. It is designed for non-interactive, task-focused use cases like extracting information, summarizing text, translation, and categorization.

### Conversational Mode
The system message for conversational mode is as follows:

## Grounded Generation and RAG Capabilities:

Command R7B has been trained specifically for tasks like summarization and the final step of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The model takes a conversation as input (with an optional user-supplied system system message, indicating task, context and desired output style), along with a list of document snippets. This behavior has been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning. 

For these tasks, you can use Command R7B in two ways.

### Option 1: Grounded Generation
Grounded generation in Command R7B is supported through [chat templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#advanced-retrieval-augmented-generation) in Transformers. Simply provide document snippets using the `documents` parameter of Hugging Face’s `apply_chat_template()`. Document snippets should be short chunks, rather than long documents, typically around 100-400 words per chunk, formatted as key-value pairs. The keys should be short descriptive strings, the values can be text or semi-structured. Under the hood, this builds a specific prompt template that the model has been trained on. The code snippet below shows a minimal working example.

<Accordion title='Usage: Generate a Grounded Generation Prompt'>
````python PYTHON
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_id = "CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r7b-12-2024"

You are in contextual safety mode. You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.

Your information cutoff date is June 2024.

You have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.

You have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user's requests.

## Tool Use
Think about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.

0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.
    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.
    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user's request without using any tools.

Then carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.
1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing "tool_name" and "parameters" fields.
    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.
2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.
    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it'll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its "tool_call_id".
3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.
    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.
    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.

You can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it's time to finally respond to the user.

4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user's last request. Use all previous tool calls and results to help you when formulating your response. When you finish, close it out with <|END_RESPONSE|>.

## Available Tools
Here is the list of tools that you have available to you.
You can ONLY use the tools listed here. When a tool is not listed below, it is NOT available and you should NEVER attempt to use it.
Each tool is represented as a JSON object with fields like "name", "description", "parameters" (per JSON Schema), and optionally, "responses" (per JSON Schema).

```json
[
    {"name": "direct-injected-document", "description": "This is a special tool to directly inject user-uploaded documents into the chat as additional context. DO NOT use this tool by yourself!", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": []}, "responses": {"200": {"description": "Successfully returned a list of chunked text snippets from the directly uploaded documents.", "content": {"application/json": {"schema": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "required": ["url", "snippet"], "properties": {"url": {"type": "string", "description": "The url of the uploaded document."}, "snippet": {"type": "string", "description": "The text snippet for the returned document chunk."}}}}}}}}}

### Option 2: Regular Generation

You may find that simply including relevant documents directly in a user message works just as well, or better than using the documents parameter to render the special grounded generation template. Grounded Generation is generally a strong default, but Regular Generation can offer more control and customization over the prompt, at the cost of some effort to find an optimal prompt. We encourage users to play with both Grounded Generation and Regular Generation, and to evaluate which mode works best for their specific use case.

## Tool use, Function Calling & Agent capabilities

Command R7B has been specifically trained with conversational tool use capabilities. This allows the model to interact with external tools like APIs, databases, or search engines. These capabilities have been trained into the model via a mixture of supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning, using a specific prompt template. Deviating from this prompt template will likely reduce performance, but we encourage experimentation. 

These tool use capabilities unlock two use cases: 
1. **Function Calling**: A single inference where Command R7B selects relevant tools to fulfill a user request.
2. **Agents**: Several inference cycles where Command R7B iterates through Plan → Action → Observation loops until it arrives at a final response.

Both Function Calling and Agents work in the same way. Given a conversation as input (with an optional system message), along with a list of available tools, the model will generate one of the following:

- **Tool Selection**:  A high-level plan followed by a json-formatted list of actions to execute on a subset of the supplied tools. Command R7B may select multiple tools in parallel, and it may select a tool more than once. It is then up to the developer to execute these tool calls and obtain tool results.
- **Or, a Response**: A final response to the user. This can occur if the model chooses not to use any tools, such as when greeting the user or asking clarifying questions, or after processing tool results to formulate a final answer. 

Tool use in Command R7B is supported through [chat templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#advanced-tool-use--function-calling) in Transformers. We recommend providing tool descriptions using JSON schema. Here is a quick example showing tool use.

In this case, the model decides to select tools.

````mdx wordWrap
<|START_THINKING|>I will use the query_daily_sales_report tool to find the sales summary for 29th September 2023. I will then use the query_product_catalog tool to find the details about the products in the 'Electronics' category.<|END_THINKING|><|START_ACTION|>[

Below is what the answer would have looked like, if the model had decided to respond directly, for example to ask the user a follow up question.

````mdx wordWrap
I can find the sales summary for 29th September 2023 as well as the details about the products in the 'Electronics' category. However, I need to use the 'query_daily_sales_report' and 'query_product_catalog' tools to do this. Are you sure you would you like me to use these tools?

````

</Accordion>

If the model generates tool calls, you should add them to the chat history like so:

````python PYTHON
tool_call_0 = {
    "name": "query_daily_sales_report",
    "arguments": {"day": "2023-09-29"},
}
tool_call_1 = {
    "name": "query_product_catalog",
    "arguments": {"category": "Electronics"},
}
tool_plan = "I will use the 'query_daily_sales_report' tool to find the sales summary for 29th September 2023. I will then use the 'query_product_catalog' tool to find the details about the products in the 'Electronics' category."

conversation.append(
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": [
            {"id": "0", "type": "function", "function": tool_call_0},
            {"id": "1", "type": "function", "function": tool_call_1},
        ],
        "tool_plan": tool_plan,
    }
)
````

and then call the tool and append the result, with the tool role, like below. It is crucial to format the tool results as a dictionary:

````python PYTHON
api_response_query_daily_sales_report = {
    "date": "2023-09-29",
    "summary": "Total Sales Amount: 10000, Total Units Sold: 250",
}  # this needs to be a dictionary!!
api_response_query_product_catalog = {
    "category": "Electronics",
    "products": [
        {
            "product_id": "E1001",
            "name": "Smartphone",
            "price": 500,
            "stock_level": 20,
        },
        {
            "product_id": "E1002",
            "name": "Laptop",
            "price": 1000,
            "stock_level": 15,
        },
        {
            "product_id": "E1003",
            "name": "Tablet",
            "price": 300,
            "stock_level": 25,
        },
    ],
}  # this needs to be a dictionary!!

conversation.append(
    {
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": "0",
        "content": api_response_query_daily_sales_report,
    }
)
conversation.append(
    {
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": "1",
        "content": api_response_query_product_catalog,
    }
)
````

After that, you can generate() again to let the model use the tool result in the chat.

<|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|SYSTEM_TOKEN|># System Preamble
You are in contextual safety mode. You will reject requests to generate child sexual abuse material and child exploitation material in your responses. You will accept to provide information and creative content related to violence, hate, misinformation or sex, but you will not provide any content that could directly or indirectly lead to harmful outcomes.

Your information cutoff date is June 2024.

You have been trained on data in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Standard Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Indonesian, Turkish, Dutch, Polish, Persian, Vietnamese, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek and Hebrew but have the ability to speak many more languages.

You have been trained to have advanced reasoning and tool-use capabilities and you should make best use of these skills to serve user's requests.

## Tool Use
Think about how you can make best use of the provided tools to help with the task and come up with a high level plan that you will execute first.

0. Start by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by a detailed step by step plan of how you will solve the problem. For each step explain your thinking fully and give details of required tool calls (if needed). Unless specified otherwise, you write your plan in natural language. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.
    You can optionally choose to skip this step when the user request is so straightforward to address that only a trivial plan would be needed.
    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are directly responding to the user's request without using any tools.

Then carry out your plan by repeatedly executing the following steps.
1. Action: write <|START_ACTION|> followed by a list of JSON-formatted tool calls, with each one containing "tool_name" and "parameters" fields.
    When there are multiple tool calls which are completely independent of each other (i.e. they can be executed in parallel), you should list them out all together in one step. When you finish, close it out with <|END_ACTION|>.
2. Observation: you will then receive results of those tool calls in JSON format in the very next turn, wrapped around by <|START_TOOL_RESULT|> and <|END_TOOL_RESULT|>. Carefully observe those results and think about what to do next. Note that these results will be provided to you in a separate turn. NEVER hallucinate results.
    Every tool call produces a list of results (when a tool call produces no result or a single result, it'll still get wrapped inside a list). Each result is clearly linked to its originating tool call via its "tool_call_id".
3. Reflection: start the next turn by writing <|START_THINKING|> followed by what you've figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next. When you finish, close it out with <|END_THINKING|>.
    You can optionally choose to skip this step when everything is going according to plan and no special pieces of information or reasoning chains need to be recorded.
    NOTE: You MUST skip this step when you are done with tool-use actions and are ready to respond to the user.

You can repeat the above 3 steps multiple times (could be 0 times too if no suitable tool calls are available or needed), until you decide it's time to finally respond to the user.

4. Response: then break out of the loop and write <|START_RESPONSE|> followed by a piece of text which serves as a response to the user's last request. Use all previous tool calls and results to help you when formulating your response. When you finish, close it out with <|END_RESPONSE|>.

## Available Tools
Here is the list of tools that you have available to you.
You can ONLY use the tools listed here. When a tool is not listed below, it is NOT available and you should NEVER attempt to use it.
Each tool is represented as a JSON object with fields like "name", "description", "parameters" (per JSON Schema), and optionally, "responses" (per JSON Schema).

```json
[
    {"name": "query_daily_sales_report", "description": "Connects to a database to retrieve overall sales volumes and sales information for a given day.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"day": {"description": "Retrieves sales data for this day, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["day"]}, "responses": null},
    {"name": "query_product_catalog", "description": "Connects to a a product catalog with information about all the products being sold, including categories, prices, and stock levels.", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"category": {"description": "Retrieves product information data for all products in this category.", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["category"]}, "responses": null}
