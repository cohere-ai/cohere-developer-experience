Here, you'll find context on [single-step tool use](/docs/tool-use) and [multi-step tool use](/docs/multi-step-tool-use).

Single-step is sometimes referred to as "function calling" because it uses functions to call external tools that augment the capabilities of large language models. Multi-step tool use is sometimes referred to as "agents," because it forms the core of many workflows relying on agents. 

You'll also find additional documentation on the various [types of parameters](/docs/parameter-types-in-tool-use) offered by Cohere's tool use functionality, as well as a guide on when to use single-step v.s. multi-step capabilities.
