[INTRODUCTION]

Translating Text with the Chat Endpoint
Cohere’s command A Translate model has been optimized for text translation in 23 languages via the Chat endpoint.

The languages translation is optimized for are: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, Persian.

Command A Translate supports a 256K input and 32K output context length, enabling you to translate long documents.

## Translation methods
You can perform translation of a text into another language with a simple prompt asking the model to translate a piece of text.

```python PYTHON 

import cohere
co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

target_language = "spanish"
content_to_translate = "Initial applications to Harvard for a psychology masters were rejected, but was eventually admitted. The initial setbacks were due to Milgramm not taking any undergraduate courses in psychology at Queens College. In 1961, Milgram received a PhD in social psychology. He became an assistant professor at Yale around the same time."

message = f"Translate everything that follows into {target_language}:\n\n{content_to_translate}"
response = co.chat(
    model="command-a-translate-08-2025",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}],
)
print(response.message.content[0].text)
```

(NOTE: Here, we are passing the target language and content to translate as a variable, but you can also just include them directly into the message asking for the translation.)

Here’s a sample output:

```mdx 
Las primeras solicitudes de ingreso a Harvard para cursar un máster en psicología fueron rechazadas, pero finalmente fue admitido. Los primeros contratiempos se debieron a que Milgram no había cursado ninguna asignatura de psicología de grado en el Queens College. En 1961, Milgram obtuvo un doctorado en psicología social. Por esas mismas fechas se convirtió en profesor adjunto en Yale.
```

## Translating long content
Command A Translate has been optimized to translate content up to 8k tokens in length. If the input you wish to translate is longer than 8k tokens, you will need to chunk it and translate each chunk via a separate API call. 

Generations will automatically stop after 8k tokens of output, meaning that any translation beyond 8k tokens willwil result in an error.

```python PYTHON 
import cohere
from typing import List

# Initialize the Cohere client
co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

# Function to split text into chunks of approximately max_tokens length
def split_text_into_chunks(text: str, max_tokens: int = 7500) -> List[str]:
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_length = 0

    for word in words:
        word_length = len(word.split())  # Count tokens as words for simplicity
        if current_length + word_length > max_tokens:
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [word]
            current_length = word_length
        else:
            current_chunk.append(word)
            current_length += word_length

    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))

    return chunks

# Function to translate a single chunk
def translate_chunk(chunk: str, target_language: str) -> str:
    message = f"Translate everything that follows into {target_language}:\n\n{chunk}"
    response = co.chat(
        model="command-a-translate-08-2025",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}],
    )
    return response.message.content[0].text

# Function to translate the entire text by chunking and merging
def translate_text(text: str, target_language: str, max_tokens: int = 7500) -> str:
    chunks = split_text_into_chunks(text, max_tokens)
    translated_chunks = [translate_chunk(chunk, target_language) for chunk in chunks]
    return " ".join(translated_chunks)

# Example usage
target_language = "Spanish"
content_to_translate = """
