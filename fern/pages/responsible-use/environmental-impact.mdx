Training large language models consumes a significant amount of energy (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf" target="_blank">Strubell, 2019</a>). In the spirit of carbon neutrality and minimizing the carbon footprint of model training, all models are trained on Google Cloud, which has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability" target="_blank">net zero emissions</a> and the goal of being <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future/" target="_blank">100% renewable by 2030</a>. Models are trained on Google Cloud TPUs_,_ which are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3079856.3080246" target="_blank">significantly more energy efficient</a> than traditional GPUs.

While training models with net zero emissions is a good first step, we acknowledge the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2020/2/27/20994118/carbon-offset-climate-change-net-zero-neutral-emissions" target="_blank">controversy of carbon neutrality</a>. In the long run, we aim to reduce our carbon footprint by using more efficient training processes, designing smaller models, and training on energy-efficient devices.

For transparency and accountability, carbon emissions are reported below per model training run using the <a href="https://mlco2.github.io/impact/" target="_blank">ML CO2 Impact Tool</a>, which follows the methodology described in (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09700" target="_blank">Lecoste, 2019</a>). Estimates are approximate upper bounds and are applicable to both Generation and Representation models. Estimates for custom model training are currently excluded.
