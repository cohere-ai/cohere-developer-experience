## Going Live

Upon registration, every Cohere user receives a free, rate-limited trial key to use with our endpoints. If you find that you are running against the trial key rate limit or want to serve Cohere in production, this page details the process of upgrading to a Production key and going live.

## Go to Production

You must acknowledge Cohereâ€™s SaaS agreement and terms of service. Your organization must also read and recognize our model limitations, model cards, and data statement.

You will be asked if your usage of Cohere API involves any of the sensitive use cases outlined in our usage guidelines. Following your acknowledgment of our terms, you will be able to generate and use a production key immediately. However, if you indicate your usage involves a sensitive use case, your production key may be rate limited the same as a trial key until our safety team reaches out and manually approves your use case. Reviews on sensitive use cases will take no longer than 72 business hours.

## Track Incidents

Navigate to our <a href="https://status.cohere.ai" target="_blank" >status page</a> which features information including a summary status indicator, component statuses, unresolved incidents, status history, and any upcoming or in-progress scheduled maintenance. We recommend subscribing for updates with an email or phone number to receive notifications whenever Cohere creates, updates or resolves an incident.
