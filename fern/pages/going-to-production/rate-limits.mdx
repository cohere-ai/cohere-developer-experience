Cohere offers two kinds of API keys: evaluation keys (free but limited in usage), and production keys (paid and not limited in usage). You can create an evaluation or production key on [the API keys page](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys). For more details on pricing please see our [pricing docs](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/how-does-cohere-pricing-work).
