Cohere offers two kinds of API keys: evaluation keys (free but limited in usage), and production keys (paid and much less limited in usage). You can create a trial or production key on [the API keys page](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys). For more details on pricing please see our [pricing docs](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/how-does-cohere-pricing-work).

The table below shows the rate limits for each endpoint, expressed in requests per minute (20/min means 20 requests per minute).
