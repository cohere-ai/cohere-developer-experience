Find information around deprecated endpoints and models with their recommended replacements. 

## Overview
As Cohere launches safer and more capable models, we will regularly retire old models. Applications relying on Cohere's models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified via email and in our documentation along with blog posts.
This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements. 

Cohere uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models: 
- **Active:** The model and endpoint are fully supported and recommended for use. 
- **Legacy:** The model and endpoints will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
- **Deprecated:** The model and endpoints are no longer available to new customers but remain available to existing users until retirement. (An existing user is defined as anyone who has used the model or endpoint within 90 days of the deprecation announcement.) A shutdown date will be assigned at that time.
- **Shutdown:** The model and endpoint are no longer available for users. Requests to shutdown models and endpoints will fail.

## Migrating to replacements
Once a model is deprecated, it is imperative to migrate all usage to a suitable replacement before the shutdown date. Requests to models and endpoints past the shutdown date will fail. 
To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend thorough testing of your applications with the new models well before the shutdown date. If your team requires assistance, do not hesitate to reach out to support@cohere.ai.

## Deprecation History
All deprecations are listed below with the most recent announcements at the top.

### 2024-12-02: Rerank v2.0
On December 2nd, 2024, we announced the release of Rerank-v3.5 along with the deprecation of the Rerank-v2.0 model family. 
Fine-tuned models created from these base models are not affected by this deprecation.

| Shutdown Date| Deprecated Model| Deprecated Model Price| Recommended Replacement|
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 2025-03-31 | `rerank-english-v2.0` | $1.00 / 1K searches | `rerank-v3.5`|
| 2025-03-31 | `rerank-multilingual-v2.0` | $1.00 / 1K searches | `rerank-v3.5`|

# Best Practices: 
1. Regularly check our documentation for updates on announcements regarding the status of models.
2. Test applications with newer models well before the shutdown date of your current model.
3. Update any production code to use an active model as soon as possible.
4. Contact support@cohere.ai if you need any assistance with migration or have any questions.
