Find information around deprecated endpoints and models with their recommended replacements. All deprecation announcements applies to models being accessed through our API. It does not apply to models served/hosted/deployed outside our API, where ad-hoc deprecation policies apply.

## Overview
As Cohere launches safer and more capable models, we will regularly retire old models. Applications relying on Cohere's models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified via email and in our documentation along with blog posts.
This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements. 

Cohere uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models: 
- **Active:** The model and endpoint are fully supported and recommended for use. 
- **Legacy:** The model and endpoints will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
- **Deprecated:** The model and endpoints are no longer available to new customers but remain available to existing users until retirement. (An existing user is defined as anyone who has used the model or endpoint within 90 days of the deprecation announcement.) A shutdown date will be assigned at that time.
- **Shutdown:** The model and endpoint are no longer available for users. Requests to shutdown models and endpoints will fail.

## Migrating to Replacements
Once a model is deprecated, it is imperative to migrate all usage to a suitable replacement before the shutdown date. Requests to models and endpoints past the shutdown date will fail. 
To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend thorough testing of your applications with the new models well before the shutdown date. If your team requires assistance, do not hesitate to reach out to support@cohere.ai.

## Notifications
Cohere notifies customer with active usage of models for upcoming shutdown dates. We notify customers of upcoming shutdown dates as follows: 

1. At model launch, we designate a “Guaranteed Available Until” date (at least one year out) 
2. We provide at least 6 months(1) notice before model retirement for publicly release models

## Model Status
All publicly released models are listed below with their status:

# Best Practices: 
1. Regularly check our documentation for updates on announcements regarding the status of models.
2. Test applications with newer models well before the shutdown date of your current model.
3. Update any production code to use an active model as soon as possible.
4. Contact support@cohere.ai if you need any assistance with migration or have any questions.
