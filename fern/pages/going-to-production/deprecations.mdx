Find information around deprecated endpoints and models with their recommended replacements. All deprecation announcements applies to models being accessed through our API. Please refer to partner documentation for deprecation policy on specific partner platforms.

## Overview
As Cohere launches safer and more capable models, we will regularly retire old models. Applications relying on Cohere's models may need occasional updates to keep working. Impacted customers will always be notified via email and in our documentation along with blog posts.
This page lists all API deprecations, along with recommended replacements. 

Cohere uses the following terms to describe the lifecycle of our models: 
- **Active:** The model and endpoint are fully supported and recommended for use. 
- **Legacy:** The model and endpoints will no longer receive updates and may be deprecated in the future.
- **Deprecated:** The model and endpoints are no longer available to new customers but remain available to existing users until retirement. (An existing user is defined as anyone who has used the model or endpoint within 90 days of the deprecation announcement.) A shutdown date will be assigned at that time.
- **Shutdown:** The model and endpoint are no longer available for users. Requests to shutdown models and endpoints will fail.

## Migrating to Replacements
Once a model is deprecated, it is imperative to migrate all usage to a suitable replacement before the shutdown date. Requests to models and endpoints past the shutdown date will fail. 
To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend thorough testing of your applications with the new models well before the shutdown date. If your team requires assistance, do not hesitate to reach out to support@cohere.ai.

## Notifications
Cohere notifies customer with active usage on deprecated models for upcoming shutdown dates. We notify customers of upcoming shutdown dates as follows: 

1. We provide at least 6 months(1) notice before model retirement for publicly release models

## Model Status
All publicly released models are listed below with their status:

## Deprecation History
All deprecations are listed below with the most recent announcements at the top.

### 2026-04-04: Embed v2.0, Aya Expanse 8B
Effective April 4th, 2026, the following models will be retired:
- `embed-english-v2.0`
- `embed-english-light-v2.0`
- `embed-multilingual-v2.0`
- `c4ai-aya-expanse-8b`
- `c4ai-aya-vision-8b`

We encourage you to migrate to our latest models, which offer enhanced performance, improved accuracy, and expanded capabilities:
- Embedding tasks alternatives:
    - `embed-english-v3.0`
    - `embed-multilingual-v3.0`
    - `embed-v4.0`
- Chat tasks alternatives:
    - `command-r7b-12-2024`
    - `command-a-03-2025`
    - `command-a-reasoning-08-2025`

Our team is here to ensure a seamless transition. For questions or assistance, please don’t hesitate reaching out to us at support@cohere.com. Thank you for your continued partnership. We look forward to powering your applications with our latest AI advancements.

### 2025-09-15: Various older command models, a number of endpoints, all of fine-tuning.
Effective September 15, 2025, the following deprecations will roll out.

Deprecated Models:
- `command-r-03-2024`  (and the alias `command-r`)
- `command-r-plus-04-2024`  (and the alias `command-r-plus`)
- `command-light` 
- `command`
- `summarize` (Refer to [the migration guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/summarizing-text#migration-from-summarize-to-chat-endpoint) for alternatives).

For command model replacements, we recommend you use `command-r-08-2024`, `command-r-plus-08-2024`, or `command-a-03-2025` (which is the strongest-performing model across domains) instead. 

Retired Fine-Tuning Capabilities:
Fine-tuning for the `command-light`, `command`, `command-r`, `classify`, and `rerank` models is being retired. This covers both the Cohere dashboard and API. Previously fine-tuned models will no longer be accessible.

Deprecated Features and API Endpoints:
- `/v1/connectors` (Managed connectors for RAG)
- `/v1/chat` parameters: `connectors`, `search_queries_only`
- `/v1/generate` (Legacy generative endpoint)
- `/v1/summarize` (Legacy summarization endpoint)
- `/v1/classify`
- Slack App integration
- Coral Web UI (chat.cohere.com and coral.cohere.com)

These changes reflect our commitment to innovation and performance optimization. We encourage users to assess their current implementations and migrate to recommended alternatives. Our support team is available at support@cohere.com to assist with the transition. For detailed guidance, please refer to our migration resources and technical documentation.

### 2025-03-08: Command-R-03-2024 Fine-tuned Models

On March 08, 2025, we will sunset all models fine-tuned with Command-R-03-2024. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our services, we are making the following changes to our fine-tuning capabilities:

- Deprecating fine-tuning with the older Command-R-03-2024 model
- All fine-tunes are now powered by the Command-R-08-2024 model.

Models fine-tuned with Command-R-03-2024 will continue to be supported until March 08, 2025. After this date, all requests to these models will return an error.

### 2025-01-31: Default Classify endpoint
After January 31st, 2025, usage of Classify endpoint via the default Embed models will be deprecated.

However, you can still use the Classify endpoint with a fine-tuned Embed model. By leveraging fine-tuning, you can achieve even better performance and accuracy in your classification tasks. Read the documentation on [Classify fine-tuning](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/classify-fine-tuning) for more information.

### 2024-12-02: Rerank v2.0
On December 2nd, 2024, we announced the release of Rerank-v3.5 along with the deprecation of the Rerank-v2.0 model family. 
Fine-tuned models created from these base models are not affected by this deprecation.

| Shutdown Date| Deprecated Model| Deprecated Model Price| Recommended Replacement|
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 2025-04-30 | `rerank-english-v2.0` | $1.00 / 1K searches | `rerank-v3.5`|
| 2025-04-30 | `rerank-multilingual-v2.0` | $1.00 / 1K searches | `rerank-v3.5`|



# Best Practices: 
1. Regularly check our documentation for updates on announcements regarding the status of models.
2. Test applications with newer models well before the shutdown date of your current model.
3. Update any production code to use an active model as soon as possible.
4. Contact support@cohere.ai if you need any assistance with migration or have any questions.
