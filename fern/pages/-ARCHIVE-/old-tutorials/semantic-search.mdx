<Note title="This Guide Uses the Embed Endpoint.">  
 You can find more information about the endpoint <a target="_blank" href="/reference/embed">here</a>.
</Note>

Language models give computers the ability to search by meaning and go beyond searching by matching keywords. This capability is called semantic search.

![](../../../assets/images/cf67b74-image.png)
In this article, we'll build a simple semantic search engine. The applications of semantic search go beyond building a web search engine. They can empower a private search engine for internal documents or records. It can be used to power features like StackOverflow's "similar questions" feature.

You can find the code in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/Basic_Semantic_Search.ipynb">notebook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/Basic_Semantic_Search.ipynb">colab</a>.

</Note>

### 1. Download the Dependencies

```python PYTHON
# Install Cohere for embeddings, Umap to reduce embeddings to 2 dimensions, 
# Altair for visualization, Annoy for approximate nearest neighbor search
pip install cohere umap-learn altair annoy datasets tqdm
```

And if you're running an older version of the SDK, you might need to upgrade it like so:

```
pip install --upgrade cohere
```

If you're running this in a jupyter notebook, you'll need to prepend a `!` to the `pip install` statement:

```
!pip install cohere umap-learn altair annoy datasets tqdm scikit-learn
```

```
!pip install --upgrade cohere
```

Get your Cohere API key by [signing up here](https://os.cohere.ai/register). Paste it in `api_key` below.

#### 1a. Import the Necessary Dependencies to Run this Example

```python PYTHON
#title Import libraries (Run this cell to execute required code) {display-mode: "form"}

import cohere
import numpy as np
import re
import pandas as pd
from tqdm import tqdm
from datasets import load_dataset
import umap
import altair as alt
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
```

### 2. Get the Archive of Questions

We'll use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/trec">trec</a> dataset which is made up of questions and their categories.

```python PYTHON
# Get dataset
dataset = load_dataset("trec", split="train")

# Import into a pandas dataframe, take only the first 1000 rows
df = pd.DataFrame(dataset)[:1000]

# Preview the data to ensure it has loaded correctly
print(df.head(10))
```

### 3. Embed the Archive

![](../../../assets/images/0da3c05-small-SemanticSearch_Visual_2.png)

Let's now embed the text of the questions.

To get a thousand embeddings of this length should take a few seconds.

```python PYTHON
# We'll set up the name of the model we want to use, the API key, and the input type.
# Create and retrieve a Cohere API key from dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/register
# Paste your API key here. Remember to not share publicly
model_name = "embed-english-v3.0"
api_key = ""
input_type_embed = "search_document"

# Now we'll set up the cohere client.
co = cohere.Client(api_key)

# Get the embeddings
embeds = co.embed(texts=list(df['text']),
                  model=model_name,
                  input_type=input_type_embed).embeddings
```

### 4. Build the Index, search Using an Index and Conduct Nearest Neighbour Search

![](../../../assets/images/b11e974-image.png)

Let's build an index using the library called annoy. Annoy is a library created by Spotify to do <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nearest_neighbor_search">nearest neighbour search</a>. Nearest neighbour search is an optimization problem that involves finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point.

```python PYTHON
# Create the search index, pass the size of embedding
search_index = AnnoyIndex(np.array(embeds).shape[1], 'angular')

# Add all the vectors to the search index
for i in range(len(embeds)):
    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])
search_index.build(10) # 10 trees
search_index.save('test.ann')
```

After building the index, we can use it to retrieve the nearest neighbours either of existing questions (section 3.1), or of new questions that we embed (section 3.2).

#### 4a. Find the Neighbours of an Example from the Dataset

If we're only interested in measuring the similarities between the questions in the dataset (no outside queries), a simple way is to calculate the similarities between every pair of embeddings we have.

```python PYTHON
# Choose an example (we'll retrieve others similar to it)
example_id = 92

# Retrieve nearest neighbors
similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_item(example_id,10,
                                                include_distances=True)

# Format and print the text and distances
results = pd.DataFrame(data={'texts': df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]['text'],
                             'distance': similar_item_ids[1]}).drop(example_id)

print(f"Question:'{df.iloc[example_id]['text']}'\nNearest neighbors:")
print(results) # NOTE: Your results might look slightly different to ours.
```

```
# Output:
Question:"What are bear and bull markets ?"
Nearest neighbors:
```

|     | texts                                          | distance |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| 614 | What animals do you find in the stock market ? | 0.896121 |
| 137 | What are equity securities ?                   | 0.970260 |
| 601 | What is \`\` the bear of beers '' ?            | 0.978348 |
| 307 | What does NASDAQ stand for ?                   | 0.997819 |
| 683 | What is the rarest coin ?                      | 1.027727 |
| 112 | What are the world 's four oceans ?            | 1.049661 |

| 871 | What are the Benelux countries ?               | 1.054899 |

#### 4b. Find the Neighbours of a User Query

We're not limited to searching using existing items. If we get a query, we can embed it and find its nearest neighbours from the dataset.

```python PYTHON
query = "What is the tallest mountain in the world?"
input_type_query = "search_query"

# Get the query's embedding
query_embed = co.embed(texts=[query],
                  model=model_name,
                  input_type=input_type_query).embeddings

# Retrieve the nearest neighbors
similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_vector(query_embed[0],10,
                                                include_distances=True)
# Format the results
query_results = pd.DataFrame(data={'texts': df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]['text'], 
                             'distance': similar_item_ids[1]})


print(f"Query:'{query}'\nNearest neighbors:")
print(query_results) # NOTE: Your results might look slightly different to ours.
```

|     | texts                                                                        | distance |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| 236 | What is the name of the tallest mountain in the world ?                      | 0.431913 |
| 670 | What is the highest mountain in the world ?                                  | 0.436290 |
| 907 | What mountain range is traversed by the highest railroad in the world ?      | 0.715265 |
| 435 | What is the highest peak in Africa ?                                         | 0.717943 |
| 354 | What ocean is the largest in the world ?                                     | 0.762917 |

| 114 | What is the largest snake in the world ?                                     | 0.789743 |
| 656 | What 's the tallest building in New York City ?                              | 0.793982 |
| 901 | What 's the longest river in the world ?                                     | 0.794352 |

### 5. Visualize the Archive

Use the code below to create a visualization of the embedded archive. As written, this code will only run in a jupyter notebook.

```python PYTHON
#@title Plot the archive {display-mode: "form"}

# UMAP reduces the dimensions from 1024 to 2 dimensions that we can plot
reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=20) 
umap_embeds = reducer.fit_transform(embeds)

# Prepare the data to plot and interactive visualization
# using Altair
df_explore = pd.DataFrame(data={'text': df['text']})
df_explore['x'] = umap_embeds[:,0]
df_explore['y'] = umap_embeds[:,1]

# Plot
chart = alt.Chart(df_explore).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x=#'x',
    alt.X('x',
        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)
    ),
    y=
    alt.Y('y',
        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)
    ),
    tooltip=['text']
).properties(
    width=700,
    height=400
)
chart.interactive()
```
