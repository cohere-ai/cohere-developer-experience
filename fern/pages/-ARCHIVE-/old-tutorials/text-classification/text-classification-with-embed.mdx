This notebook shows how to build a classifiers using Cohere's embeddings. You can find the code on [Github](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/Text_Classification_Using_Embeddings.ipynb) or in this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/blob/main/notebooks/Text_Classification_Using_Embeddings.ipynb).

The example classification task here will be sentiment analysis of film reviews. We'll train a simple classifier to detect whether a film review is negative (class 0) or positive (class 1).

We'll go through the following steps:

1. Install Cohere
2. Get the dataset
3. Get the embeddings of the reviews (for both the training set and the test set)
4. Train a classifier using the training set
5. Evaluate the performance of the classifier on the testing set

## 1. Install Cohere and Other Dependencies
