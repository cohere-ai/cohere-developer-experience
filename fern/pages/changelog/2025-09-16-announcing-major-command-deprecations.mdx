 This announcement covers a series of major deprecations, including of classic Command models, several parameters, and entire endpoints.
---

As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering advanced AI solutions, we are deprecating the following models, features, and API endpoints:

Deprecated Models:
- `command-light` 
- `command`
- summarize (Refer to [the migration guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/summarizing-text#migration-from-summarize-to-chat-endpoint) for alternatives).

For command model replacements, we recommend you use `command-r-08-2024`, `command-r-plus-08-2024`, or `command-a-03-2025` (which is the strongest-performing model across domains) instead. 

Retired Fine-Tuning Capabilities:
All fine-tuning options via dashboard and API for models including `command-light`, `command`, `command-r`, `classify`, and `rerank` are being retired. Previously fine-tuned models will no longer be accessible.

Deprecated Features and API Endpoints:
- `/v1/connectors` (Managed connectors for RAG)
- `/v1/chat` parameters: `connectors`, `search_queries_only`
- `/v1/generate` (Legacy generative endpoint)
- `/v1/summarize` (Legacy summarization endpoint)
- `/v1/classify`
- Slack App integration
- Coral Web UI (chat.cohere.com and coral.cohere.com)
