  Launch of multimodal embeddings for our Embed models, plus some code to help get started.
---

Today we’re announcing updates to our embed-v3.0 family of models. These models now have the ability to process images into embeddings. There is no change to existing text capabilities which means there is no need to re-embed texts you have already processed with our `embed-v3.0` models.

In the rest of these release notes, we’ll provide more details about technical enhancements, new features, and new pricing.

## Technical Details
### API Changes:
The Embed API has two major changes: 
- Introduced a new `input_type` called `image`
- Introduced a new parameter called `images`

Example request on how to process 

```Text cURL
POST https://api.cohere.ai/v1/embed
{
    "model": "embed-multilingual-v3.0",
    "input_type": "image",
    "embedding_types": ["float"],
    "images": [enc_img]
}
```
### Restrictions: 
- The API only accepts images in the base format of the following: `png`, `jpeg`,`Webp`, and `gif`
- Image embeddings currently does not support batching so the max images sent per request is 1
- The maximum image sizez is `5mb`
- The `images` parameter only accepts a base64 encoded image formatted as a Data Url
