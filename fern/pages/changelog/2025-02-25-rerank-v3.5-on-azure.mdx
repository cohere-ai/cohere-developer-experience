In December 2024, Cohere released [Rerank v3.5 model](https://docs.cohere.com/changelog/rerank-v3.5). It demonstrates SOTA performance on multilingual retrieval, reasoning, and tasks in domains as varied as finance, eCommerce, hospitality, project management, and email/messaging retrieval.

This model has been available through the Cohere API, but today we’re pleased to announce that it can also be utilized through Microsoft Azure's AI Foundry!

You can find more information about using Cohere’s embedding models on AI Foundry [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cohere-on-microsoft-azure).
