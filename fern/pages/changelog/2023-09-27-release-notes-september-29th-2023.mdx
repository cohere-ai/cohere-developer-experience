**We're Releasing co.chat() and the Chat + RAG Playground**

We're pleased to announce that we've released our `co.chat()` beta! Of particular importance is the fact that the `co.chat()` API is able to utilize [retrieval augmented generation](/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) (RAG), meaning developers can provide sources of context that inform and ground the model's output.

This represents a leap forward in the accuracy, verifiability, and timeliness of our generative AI offering. For our public beta, developers can connect `co.chat()` to web search or plain text documents.

Access to the `co.chat()` public beta is available through an API key included with a Cohere account.

**Our Command Model has Been Updated**

We've updated both the `command` and `command-light` models. Expect improved question answering, generation quality, rewriting and conversational capabilities.

**New Rate Limits**

For all trial keys and all endpoints, there is now a rate limit of 5000 calls per month.
