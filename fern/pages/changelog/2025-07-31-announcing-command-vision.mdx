## 💻 Getting Started

The API structure is identical to our existing Command models, making integration seamless:

response = co.chat(
    model="command-a-vision",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Analyze this chart and extract the key data points",
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {"url": "your-image-url"},
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
)
```
