We're excited to introduce improvements to our Chat, Classify, Embed, and Rerank APIs in a major version upgrade, making it easier and faster to build with Cohere. We are also releasing a new SDK, `cohere.ClientV2`. 

## What's new

We are changing the following Chat API parameters that were previously available in V1:

* `connectors`, which allowed users to register a data source for Cohere to query for RAG. To use the Chat V2 API with web search, follow this guide to implement a web search tool.
* `conversation_id`, used to manage chat history on behalf of the developer.
* `prompt_truncation`, used to automatically rerank and remove documents if the query did not fit in the model’s context limit.
* `search_queries_only`, which generates only a search query given a user’s message input. This feature will only be supported by the V1 Chat API and support will be added in V2 at a later date.
* `force_single_step`, which forced the model to finish tool calling in one set of turns.
* `preamble`, used for giving the model task, context, and style instructions. Use a system turn at the beginning of your message history to migrate to V2.
* `citation_quality`, for users to select between fast citations, accurate citations (slightly higher latency than fast), or no citations. This will be replaced by a `citation_options` parameter, wherein users can set `citation_modes`. 


These APIs are in Beta and are subject to updates. We welcome feedback in our Discord channel.
