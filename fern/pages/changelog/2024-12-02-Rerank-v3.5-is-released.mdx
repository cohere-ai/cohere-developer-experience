  Release announcment for Rerank 3.5 - our new state of the art model for ranking.
---

We're pleased to announce the release of [Rerank 3.5](/docs/rerank-2) our newest and most performant foundational model for ranking. Rerank 3.5 has a context length of 4096, SOTA performance on Multilingual Retrieval tasks and Reasoning Capabilities. In addition, Rerank 3.5 has SOTA performance on BEIR and domains such as Finance, E-commerce, Hospitality, Project Management, and Email/Messaging Retrieval tasks.

In the rest of these release notes, weâ€™ll provide more details about changes to the api.

## Technical Details

### API Changes:

Along with the model, we are releasing V2 of the Rerank API. It includes the following major changes:
- `model` is now a required parameter
- `max_chunks_per_doc` has been replaced by `max_tokens_per_doc`; `max_tokens_per_doc` will determine the maximum amount of tokens a document can have before truncation. The default value for `max_tokens_per_doc` is 4096.
- support for passing a list of objects for the `documents` parameter has been removed - if your documents contain structured data, for best performance we recommend formatting them as [YAML strings](/docs/rerank-overview#example-with-structured-data).
