With the release of our latest Python SDK, there are a number of functions that are no longer supported, including `create_custom_models`.

For more granular instructions on upgrading to the new SDK, and what that will mean for your Cohere integrations, see the comprehensive [migration guide](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-python/blob/main/4.0.0-5.0.0-migration-guide.md).
