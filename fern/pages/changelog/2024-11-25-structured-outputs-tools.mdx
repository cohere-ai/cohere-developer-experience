  Structured Outputs now supports both JSON and tool use scenarios.
---

Today, we're pleased to announce that we have added Structured Outputs support for tool use in the Chat API.

Structured Outputs was available with JSON. Now, Structured Outputs will be available with Tools as well.

This ensures that tool calls will follow exactly the tools schema provided. This means the tool calls will adhere to the tool names, parameter names, parameter data types, and required parameters.

See the [Structured Outputs documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/structured-outputs-json) to learn more.
