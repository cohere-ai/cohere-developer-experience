  Structured Outputs now supports both JSON and tool use scenarios.
---

Today, we're pleased to announce that we have added Structured Outputs support for tool use in the Chat API.

Structured Outputs was available with JSON. Now, Structured Outputs will be available with Tools as well.

Setting `strict_tools` to `true` ensures that tool calls will follow the  provided tool schema exactly. This means the tool calls are guaranteed to adhere to the tool names, parameter names, parameter data types, and required parameters, without the risk of hallucinations.

See the [Structured Outputs documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/structured-outputs-json) to learn more.
