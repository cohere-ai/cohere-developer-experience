Effective January 31st, 2025, we are deprecating the use of default Embed models with the Classify endpoint.

This deprecation does not affect usage of the Classify endpoint with fine-tuned Embed models. Fine-tuned models continue to be fully supported and are recommended for achieving optimal classification performance. 

For guidance on implementing Classify with fine-tuned models, please refer to our [Classify fine-tuning documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/classify-fine-tuning).
