Today, we are releasing our Compatibility API, enabling developers to seamlessly use Cohere's models via OpenAI's SDK.

This API enables you to switch your existing OpenAI-based applications to use Cohere's models without major refactoring.

It includes comprehensive support for chat completions, such as function calling and structured outputs, as well as support for text embeddings generation.

Check out [our documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/compatibility-api) on how to get started with the Compatibility API, with examples in Python, TypeScript, and cURL.
