We are updating the names of our models to bring consistency and simplicity to our product offerings. As of today, you will be able to call Cohereâ€™s models via our API and SDK with the new model names, and all of our documentation has been updated to reflect the new naming convention.

These changes are backwards compatible, so you can also continue to call our models with the **Previous Names** found in the table below until further notice.

| Model Type | Previous Name          | New Name                 | Endpoint    |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |

| Generative | command-medium         | command-light            | co.generate |
| Generative | command-xlarge-nightly | command-nightly          | co.generate |

| Generative | xlarge                 | base                     | co.generate |
| Generative | medium                 | base-light               | co.generate |
