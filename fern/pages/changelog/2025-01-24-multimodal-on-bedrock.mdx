In October, Cohere updated our embeddings models to be able to [process images](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/embeddings#image-embeddings) in addition to text.

These enhanced models have been available through the Cohere API, but today we’re pleased to announce that they can also be utilized through the powerful Amazon Bedrock cloud computing platform!

You can find more information about using Cohere’s embedding models on Bedrock [here](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/amazon-bedrock).
