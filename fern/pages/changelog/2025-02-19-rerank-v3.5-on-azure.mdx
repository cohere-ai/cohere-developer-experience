In December 2024, Cohere released an [updated Rerank model](https://docs.cohere.com/changelog/rerank-v3.5), v3.5. It demonstrated SOTA performance on multilingual retrieval, reasoning, and tasks in domains as varied as finance, eCommerce, hospitality, project management, and email/messaging retrieval.

These enhanced models have been available through the Cohere API, but today we’re pleased to announce that they can also be utilized through Microsoft Azure's AI Foundry!

You can find more information about using Cohere’s embedding models on AI Foundry [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/cohere-on-microsoft-azure).
