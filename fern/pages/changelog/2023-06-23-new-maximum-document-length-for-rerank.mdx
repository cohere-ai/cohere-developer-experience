  Stay up-to-date with our latest changes to co.rerank, including an updated
  maximum document calculation and error prevention.

We have updated how the maximum number of documents is calculated for co.rerank. The endpoint will error if `len(documents) * max_chunks_per_doc >10,000` where `max_chunks_per_doc` is set to 10 as default.
