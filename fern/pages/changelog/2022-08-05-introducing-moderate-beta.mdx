Use Moderate (Beta) to classify harmful text across the following categories: `profane`, `hate speech`, `violence`, `self-harm`, `sexual`, `sexual (non-consenual)`, `harassment`, `spam`, `information hazard (e.g., pii)`. Moderate returns an array containing each category and its associated confidence score. Over the coming weeks, expect performance to improve significantly as we optimize the underlying model.
