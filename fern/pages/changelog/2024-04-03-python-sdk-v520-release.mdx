We've released an additional update for our Python SDK! Here are the highlights.

- The tokenize and detokenize functions in the Python SDK now default to using a _local_ tokenizer.
- When using the local tokenizer, the response will not include `token_strings`, but users can revert to using the hosted tokenizer by specifying `offline=False`.
- Also, `model` will now be a required field.
- For more information, see the guide for [tokens and tokenizers](/docs/tokens-and-tokenizers).
