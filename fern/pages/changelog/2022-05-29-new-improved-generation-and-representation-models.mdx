  Experience improved performance and flexibility with our updated models, now
  supporting longer contexts of up to 4096 tokens.

We've retrained our `small`, `medium`, and `large` generation and representation models. Updated representation models now support contexts up to 4096 tokens (previously 1024 tokens). We recommend keeping text lengths below 512 tokens for optimal performance; for any text longer than 512 tokens, the text is spliced and the resulting embeddings of each component are then averaged and returned.
