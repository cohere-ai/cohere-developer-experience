  Release announcment for Command A - our [TODO FILL IN].
---

We're thrilled to announce the release of Command A, the [TODO FILL IN]family of enterprise-focused [large language models](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform#large-language-models-llms) (LLMs). With a context window of 128K, Command R7B offers state-of-the-art performance across a variety of real-world tasks, and is designed for use cases in which speed, cost, and compute are important. Specifically, Command R7B is excellent for [retrieval-augmented generation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag), [tool use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tool-use), and [agentic applications](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multi-step-tool-use) where complex reasoning, multiple actions, and information-seeking are important for success.

Command R7B is available today on the [Cohere Platform](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform) as well as accessible on HuggingFace, or you can access it in the SDK with `command-<model_name>-MM-YYYY`. For more information, check out our [dedicated blog post](TODO).
