---

We're thrilled to announce the release of Command A, the most recent entrant into the Command family of enterprise-focused [large language models](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform#large-language-models-llms) (LLMs).

[Command A](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-a) is Cohere's most performant model to date, excelling at real world enterprise tasks including tool use, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), agents, and multilingual use cases. With 111B parameters and a context length of 256K, Command A boasts a considerable increase in inference-time efficiency -- 150% higher throughput compared to its predecessor Command R+ 08-2024 -- and only requires 2 GPUs (A100s / H100s) to run.

Command A is available today on the [Cohere Platform](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/the-cohere-platform), [HuggingFace](TODO), or through the SDK with `command-a-03-2025`. For more information, check out our [dedicated blog post](TODO).
