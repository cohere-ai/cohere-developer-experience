  New Representation Model sizes and an increased token limit offer improved
  performance and flexibility.
---
Representation Models are now available in the sizes of `medium-20220217` and `large-20220217` as well as an updated version of `small-20220217`. Our previous `small` model will be available as `small-20211115`. In addition, the maximum tokens length per text has increased from 512 to 1024. We recommend keeping text lengths below 128 tokens for optimal performance; for any text longer than 128 tokens, the text is spliced and the resulting embeddings of each component are then averaged and returned.
