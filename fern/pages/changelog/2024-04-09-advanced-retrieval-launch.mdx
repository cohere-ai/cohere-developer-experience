We're pleased to announce the release of [Rerank 3](/docs/rerank-2) our newest and most performant foundational model for ranking. Rerank 3 boast a context length of 4096, SOTA performance on Code Retrieval, Long Document, and Semi-Structured Data. In addition to quality improvements, we've improved inference speed by a factor of 2x for short documents (doc length \< 512 tokens) and 3x for long documents (doc length ~4096 tokens).
