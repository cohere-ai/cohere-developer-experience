---

We're excited to announce the release of **Command A Translate**, Cohere's most powerful and advanced machine translation model to date that excels at translating between 23 languages with exceptional accuracy and fluency. 

## Key Features
- **23 supported languages**: English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Czech, Indonesian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Greek, Hindi, Hebrew, and Persian
- **111 billion parameters** for superior translation quality
- **16K token context length** (8K input + 8K output) for handling longer texts
- **Optimized for deployment** on 1-2 GPUs (A100s/H100s)
- **Secure deployment options** for sensitive data translation

## Getting Started

The model is available immediately through Cohere's Chat API endpoint. You can start translating text with simple prompts or integrate it programmatically into your applications.

```python
from cohere import ClientV2

co = cohere.ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR API KEY>")

response = co.chat(
    model="command-a-translate-08-2025",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Translate this text to Spanish: Hello, how are you?"}],
)
```

## Availability

Command A Translate (`command-a-translate-08-2025`) is now available for all Cohere users through our standard API endpoints. For enterprise customers, [private deployment](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/private-deployment-overview) options are available to ensure maximum security and control over your translation workflows.
