  Release announcement for the ability to work with multimodal image models on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure platform.

In October 2024, Cohere updated our embeddings models to be able to [process images](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/embeddings#image-embeddings) in addition to text.

These enhanced models have been available through the Cohere API, but today we’re pleased to announce that they can also be utilized through the powerful Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) computing platform!

You can find more information about using Cohere’s embedding models on OCI [here](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-oci).
