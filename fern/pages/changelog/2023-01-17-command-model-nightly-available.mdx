  Introducing Command-Nightly: improved nightly versions of our Common models,
  now available in medium and x-large sizes.
---
Nightly versions of our Common models are now available. This means that every week, you can expect the performance of command-nightly to improve as we continually retrain them.

Command-nightly will be available in two sizes - `medium` and `xlarge`. The `xlarge` model demonstrates better performance, and medium is a great option for developers who require fast response, like those building chatbots. You can find more information [here](/docs/command-beta).

If you were previously using the `command-xlarge-20221108` model, you will now be redirected to the `command-xlarge-nightly` model. Please note that access to the `command-xlarge-20221108` model will be discontinued after January 30, 2023. The `command-xlarge-nightly` model has shown enhancements in all generative tasks, and we anticipate you will notice an improvement.
