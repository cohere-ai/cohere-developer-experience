 This announcement covers the release of Command A Reasoning, Cohere's first model able to engage in thinking and reasoning.
---

We’re excited to announce the release of **Command A Reasoning**, a hybrid reasoning model designed to excel at complex agentic tasks, in English and 22 other languages. With 111 billion parameters and a 256K context length, this model brings advanced reasoning capabilities to your applications through the familiar Command API interface.

**Key Features**  
- **Tool Use**: Provides the strongest tool use performance out of the Command family of models.
- **Agentic Applications**: Demonstrates proactive problem-solving, autonomously using tools and resources to complete highly complex tasks.
- **Multilingual**: With 23 languages supported, the model solves reasoning and agentic problems in the language your business operates in.

**Technical Specifications**  
- **Model Name**: `command-a-reasoning-08-2025`  
- **Context Length**: 256K tokens  
- **Maximum Output**: 32K tokens  
- **API Endpoint**: Chat API  

### Getting Started
Integrating Command A Reasoning is straightforward using the Chat API. Here’s a non-streaming example:  

<CodeBlocks>
```python PYTHON 
from cohere import ClientV2

co = ClientV2("<YOUR_API_KEY>")

prompt = """
Alice has 3 brothers and she also has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Alice's brother have?
"""

response = co.chat(
    model="command-a-reasoning-08-2025",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt,
        }
    ],
)

for content in response.message.content:
	if content.type == "thinking":
		print("Thinking:", content.thinking)

	if content.type == "text":
		print("Response:", content.text)
```

```python PYTHON (Streaming) 
from cohere import ClientV2

co = ClientV2(api_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>")        

prompt = """
Alice has 3 brothers and she also has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Alice's brother have?
"""

response = co.chat_stream(
    model="command-a-reasoning-08-2025",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt,
        }
    ],
)
for event in response:
    if event.type == "content-delta":
        if event.delta.message.content.thinking:
            print(event.delta.message.content.thinking, end="")
        if event.delta.message.content.text:
            print(event.delta.message.content.text, end="")
```
</CodeBlocks>

**Customization Options**  

You can enable and disable thinking capabilities using the `thinking` parameter, and steer the model's output with a flexible user-controlled thinking budget; for more details on token budgets, advanced configurations, and best practices, refer to our dedicated [Reasoning documentation](/docs/reasoning).
