Our ready-to-use large language models, such as `Command R`, as well as `Command R+`, are very good at producing responses to natural language prompts. However, there are many cases in which getting the best model performance requires performing an **additional** round of training on custom user data. Creating a custom model using this process is called **fine-tuning**.

### Why Fine-tune?

Fine-tuning is recommended when you want to teach the model a new task, or leverage your company's unique knowledge base. Fine-tuning models is also helpful for generating a specific writing style or format. 

If you are aiming to use a language model to draft responses to customer-support inquiries, for example, using a model fine-tuned on old conversations with customers will likely improve the quality of the output.

Note that there might be pricing differences when using fine-tuned models. You can use our [Pricing Calculator](https://cohere.com/pricing) to estimate the costs.

### How to Create Fine-tuned Models

Cohere offers two methods of creating fine-tuned models: via the [Cohere Dashboard](http://dashboard.cohere.com/fine-tuning), via the [Fine-tuning API,](/reference/listfinetunedmodels) and via the [Python SDK](/docs/fine-tuning-with-the-python-sdk). The fine-tuning process generally unfolds in four main stages:

- Preparing and uploading training data.
- Training the new Fine-tuned model.
- Evaluating the Fine-tuned model (and possibly repeating the training).
- Deploying the Fine-tuned model.

Once you Fine-tune a model, it will start appearing in the model selection dropdown on the Playground, and can be used in API calls.

### Types of Fine-tuning

Models are fine-tuned for use in specific Cohere APIs. To be compatible with the Chat API, for example, a model needs to be fine-tuned on a dataset of conversations. APIs that support fine-tuned models are:

- [Chat](/docs/chat-fine-tuning)
- [Classify](/docs/classify-fine-tuning)
- [Rerank](/docs/rerank-fine-tuning)
