## What is the Playground?

The [Cohere Playground](https://dashboard.cohere.com/playground) is a visual interface for users to try out our APIs and iterate on prompts without writing a single line of code. Use the Playground to test your use cases and when you're ready to start building, simply click `View Code` to get the code version that you can add to your application.

## Using the Playground

### Chat

The [Chat endpoint](/reference/chat)  provides a natural language response to a prompt.  You can use the Chat Playground to generate text, answer a question or create content.  You can set the system message to customize the model behavior.

- To write inputs that produce the best results for your use case, read our [Prompt Engineering](/docs/prompt-engineering) guide.
- Try tinkering with different [temperature](/docs/temperature)  to get different outputs.

### Embed

The [Embed endpoint](/reference/embed) enables users to assign numerical representations to strings and visualize comparative meaning on a 2-dimensional plane. Phrases similar in meaning should ideally be closer together on this visualization. Add a couple of your own phrases and see if the Playground visualization feels accurate to you.

Cohere [embeddings](/docs/embeddings) can be used to train a semantic classifier out of the box, saving users countless hours gathering data to train a model themselves.
