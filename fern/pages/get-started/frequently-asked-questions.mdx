Here, we'll walk through some common questions we get about how Cohere's models work, what pricing options there are, and more!

## Cohere Models 
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between Command R+ and other Command models?">

Command R+ is most suitable for those workflows that lean on complex RAG functionality and multi-step tool use (agents). Command R, on the other hand, is great for simpler retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and single-step tool use tasks, as well as applications where price is a major consideration. We offer a full model overview in our [documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between Aya and Command R models?">

Aya specializes in human-like multilingual text generation and conversations, ideal for content creation and chatbots. Command R excels at understanding and executing instructions, enabling interactive applications and data-driven tasks.This makes it more suitable for many enterprise use cases.

You can check out [this link](https://cohere.com/research/aya) to learn more about Aya models, datasets and related research papers.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Cohere's language model compare to other LLMs like GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others?">

Cohere’s Command models have strong performance across enterprise tasks such as summarization, multilingual use cases, and retrieval augmented generation. We also have the widest range of deployment options, you can check it [here](https://cohere.com/deployment-options). 

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I use Cohere's models for tasks like translation, text embedding, summarization, and custom tool development?">

You can access Cohere’s models through our platform (cohere.com) or through various cloud platforms including, but not limited to, Sagemaker, Bedrock, Azure AI, and OCI Generatie AI. We also have private deployments. In terms of use case specific features, please reference the latest [API documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/about) to learn more about the API features and [Cookbooks](https://docs.cohere.com/page/cookbooks) with starter code for various tasks to aid development. 

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are some best practices, tips, and techniques for prompt engineering?">

You can find our prompt engineering recommendations in the following resources:
- [Prompt Engineering Basics](https://cohere.com/llmu/prompt-engineering-basics)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I effectively use and fine-tune models for specific tasks, like data extraction, question answering, and generating content within certain constraints?">

To fine-tune models for tasks like data extraction, question answering, or content generation, it’s important to start by defining your goals and ensuring your data captures the task accurately.

For generative models, fine-tuning involves training on input-output pairs, where the model learns to generate specific outputs based on given inputs. This is ideal for tasks like customizing responses or enforcing a particular writing style.

For tasks like data extraction, fine-tuning helps the model identify relevant patterns and structure data as needed. High-quality, task-specific data is essential for achieving accurate results.

For more details, you can refer to [Cohere’s fine-tuning guide](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/fine-tuning) for best practices.

Fine tuning is a powerful capability, but takes some effort to get right. You should first understand what you are trying to achieve and then determine if the data you are planning to train on effectively captures that task. The generative models specifically learn off of input/output pairs and therefore need to see examples of the expected input for your task and the ideal output. For more information, see our [finetuning guide](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/chat-improving-the-results).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the best practices for preparing and structuring fine-tuning data, and what are the supported file formats?">

You can find the best practices for preparing and structuring fine-tuning data across these three modules. Data preparation for [chat fine-tuning](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/chat-preparing-the-data), [classify fine-tuning](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/classify-preparing-the-data) and [rerank fine-tuning](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/rerank-preparing-the-data). The primary file formats supported are jsonl and csv.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What models are available for fine-tuning using the Cohere platform?">

We support fine-tuning for Command R, Command R 082024 (to be launched October 1st) on the generative side, and for Classify and Rerank models on the representation side.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What specific models are being developed by Cohere and where can I find detailed information about them?">

For the latest current offerings, you should reference our [models page](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/models).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which model should I choose for my specific use case?">

This largely depends on your use case. In general, Cohere has both generative and representation models. The [models page](https://docs.cohere.com/v1/docs/models) has more information on each of these, but use cases can often use a combination of models.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the capabilities of Cohere's models?">

Cohere models offer a wide range of capabilities, from advanced generative tasks to semantic search and other representation use cases. All of our models are multilingual and can support use cases from [RAG](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) to [Tool Use](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/tools) and much more.

Our [Command](https://cohere.com/command) model family is our flagship series of generative models. These models excel at taking a user instruction (or command) and generating text following the instruction. They also have conversational capabilities which means that they are well-suited for chatbots and virtual assistants.

For representation tasks, we offer two key models:

- [Embed](https://cohere.com/embed): Embed models generate embeddings from text, allowing for tasks like classification, clustering, and semantic search.
- [Rerank](https://cohere.com/rerank): Rerank models improve the output of search and ranking systems by re-organizing results according to specific parameters, improving the relevance and accuracy of search results.

Our models perform best when used end-to-end in their intended workflows. For a detailed breakdown of each model, including their latest versions, check our [models page](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the best practices and resources for building a search system for large PDF documents, and how can I optimize the retrieval process using language models and embeddings?">

While this depends on the document structure itself, the best rule of thumb would be to split the PDF into its pages and then split each page into chunks that fit our context length.

From there, you should associate each chunk to a page and a doc id which will allow you to have various levels of granularity for retrieval.

You can find further guides on [chunking strategies](https://docs.cohere.com/page/chunking-strategies) and [handling PDFs with mixed data](https://docs.cohere.com/page/agentic-rag-mixed-data).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I develop a multilingual chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries in different languages, incorporate external data, and perform tasks like text search, citation generation, and answer reranking?">

Cohere’s models offer multilingual capabilities out of the box. You can reference our example notebooks such as this [RAG one](https://docs.cohere.com/page/basic-rag) to get a better idea of how to piece these models together to build a question answering application.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the implications and limitations of using an unsupported language in Command-R, and are there plans to expand language support?">

We are always looking to expand multilingual support to other languages. Command R/R+ have been exposed to other languages during training and we encourage you to try it on your use case. If you would like to provide feedback or suggestions on additional languages, please don't hesitate to contact support@cohere.com.

## Troubleshooting Errors 
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="When using Cohere's API, why am I encountering errors related to dataset creation, API key limitations, or missing artifacts, and how can these issues be resolved?">

Here are some common errors and potential solutions for dealing with errors related to API key limitations or missing artifacts. 

#### API Key Limitations

Cohere's API keys have certain limitations and permissions associated with them. If you are encountering errors related to API key limitations, it could be due to the following reasons:
- Rate Limits: Cohere's API has rate limits in place to ensure fair usage. If you exceed the allowed number of requests within a specific time frame, you may receive an error. To resolve this, double check the rate limits for your API plan and ensure your usage is within the specified limits. You can also implement a rate-limiting mechanism in your code to control the frequency of API requests.
- API Key Expiration: API keys may have an expiration date. If your key has expired, it will no longer work.Check the validity period of your API key and renew it if necessary. Contact Cohere's support team if you need assistance with key renewal.

#### Missing Artifacts

Cohere's dataset creation process involves generating artifacts, which are essential components for training models. If you receive errors about missing artifacts, consider the following:

- Incorrect Dataset Format: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format required by Cohere's API. Different tasks (e.g., classification, generation) may have specific formatting requirements. Review the documentation for dataset formatting guidelines and ensure your data adheres to the specified structure.
- File Upload Issues: Artifacts are generated after successfully uploading your dataset files. Issues with file uploads can lead to missing artifacts. Verify that your dataset files are accessible and not corrupted. You should also check file size limits to ensure your files meet the requirements. 
- Synchronization Delay: Sometimes, there might be a slight delay in generating artifacts after uploading the dataset. Wait for a few minutes and refresh the dataset status to see if the artifacts are generated.

#### General Troubleshooting Steps

If your problem doesn't fall into these buckets, here are a few other things you can try:

- Check API Documentation: Review the Cohere [API documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/about) for dataset creation to ensure you are following the correct steps and parameters.
- Inspect API Responses: Carefully examine the error responses returned by the API. They often contain valuable information about the issue. Cohere uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general:
    - Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
    - Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.).
    - Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Cohere’s servers (these are rare).

Review the [Errors page](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/errors) to learn more about how to deal with non-2xx response code. 

#### Reach Out to Cohere Support

If the issue persists, contact Cohere's support team. They can provide personalized assistance and help identify any specific problems with your API integration.

## Legal, Security, Data Privacy

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Is my data private and secure when using Cohere platform, or is it accessible to others?">

When you’re using Cohere models via our Platform, we segment your data using logical segmentation. When using Cohere models via a private or cloud deployment from one of our partners, your data is not shared with Cohere.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Could you provide more specific information about your GDPR compliance practices and policies, including any relevant documentation, so that I can forward the details to our legal team for review?">

We support our enterprise customers’ privacy and data security compliance needs by offering multiple deployment options so customers can control access to data and personal information under their control. Seamlessly complete your privacy and security compliance reviews by visiting Cohere’s [Trust Center](https://cohere-inc.secureframetrust.com/) where you can request a copy of our SOC 2 Type II Report, and review our privacy documentation and other compliance resources.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can we ensure we follow best practices to secure our system using Cohere, and how can we communicate that to our clients when they raise concerns about potential vulnerabilities associated with using AI?">

When it comes to using AI models securely, two important areas stand out.

#### 1. Model Security and Safety

This responsibility lies primarily with the model provider, and at Cohere, we are deeply committed to ensuring responsible AI development. Our team includes some of the top experts in AI security and safety. We lead through various initiatives, including governance and compliance frameworks, safety and security protocols, strict data controls for model training, and industry thought leadership.

#### 2. Secure Application Development with Cohere Models:
While Cohere ensures the model's security, customers are responsible for building and deploying applications using these models securely. A strong focus on a Secure Product Lifecycle is essential, and our models integrate seamlessly into this process. Core security principles remain as relevant in the AI space as elsewhere. For example, robust authentication protocols should exist for all users, services, and micro-services. Secrets, tokens, and credentials must be tightly controlled and regularly monitored.

#### Our recommendations:
- Implement responsible AI and governance policies in your AI development process, focusing on customer safety and security.
- Continuously monitor the performance of your applications and promptly address any issues that arise.

We also regularly share insights and best practices on AI security on our blog. Here are a few examples: [1](https://cohere.com/blog/how-generative-ai-has-changed-security-2), [2](https://cohere.com/blog/tackling-ai-security-risks-with-eyes-wide-open), [3](https://cohere.com/blog/building-robust-enterprise-ai-solutions-insights-on-llm-performance-safety-and-future-trends).
