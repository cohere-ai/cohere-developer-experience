Semantic search, powered by text embeddings, enables applications to perform information retrieval based on the context or meaning in textual documents.

<Steps>
### Setup
This quickstart example uses the `cohere` Python SDK. Install with the following command:

```bash
pip install -U cohere
```

Next, import the library and create a client.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cohere Platform">

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.Client("COHERE_API_KEY") # Get your free API key here: https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Private Deployment">

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.Client(api_key="", # Leave this blank
                   base_url="<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL>")
```

</Tab>

```python PYTHON
import cohere

co = cohere.BedrockClient(
    aws_region="AWS_REGION",
    aws_access_key="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",

### Document Embeddings
First, embed the list of available documents using the Embed endpoint by specifying the `input_type` as `search_document`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cohere Platform">
```python PYTHON
# Define the documents
documents = [
    {"text": "Joining Slack Channels: You will receive an invite via email. Be sure to join relevant channels to stay informed and engaged."},
    {"text": "Finding Coffee Spots: For your caffeine fix, head to the break room's coffee machine or cross the street to the café for artisan coffee."},
    {"text": "Team-Building Activities: We foster team spirit with monthly outings and weekly game nights. Feel free to suggest new activity ideas anytime!"},
    {"text": "Working Hours Flexibility: We prioritize work-life balance. While our core hours are 9 AM to 5 PM, we offer flexibility to adjust as needed."},
    {"text": "Side Projects Policy: We encourage you to pursue your passions. Just be mindful of any potential conflicts of interest with our business."}
]

# Embed the documents
doc_emb = co.embed(
    model="embed-english-v3.0",
    input_type="search_document",
    texts=[doc['text'] for doc in documents],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Private Deployment">

# Embed the documents
doc_emb = co.embed(
    input_type="search_document",
    texts=[doc['text'] for doc in documents],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```

    input_type="search_document",
    texts=[doc['text'] for doc in documents],
    embedding_types=["float"]

```

### Query Embedding
Next, embed the user query using the Embed endpoint by specifying the `input_type` as `search_query`.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cohere Platform">
```python PYTHON
# Add the user query
query = "Ways to connect with my teammates"

# Embed the query
query_emb = co.embed(
    model="embed-english-v3.0",
    input_type="search_query",
    texts=[query],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Private Deployment">
```python PYTHON
# Add the user query
query = "Ways to connect with my teammates"

# Embed the query
query_emb = co.embed(
    input_type="search_query",
    texts=[query],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Bedrock">
```python PYTHON

    input_type="search_query",
    texts=[query],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="SageMaker">
```python PYTHON
# Add the user query
query = "Ways to connect with my teammates"

# Embed the query
query_emb = co.embed(
    model="YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME",
    input_type="search_query",
    texts=[query],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Azure AI">

query_emb = co.embed(
    input_type="search_query",
    texts=[query],
    embedding_types=["float"]
).embeddings.float
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Semantic Search

Then, perform semantic search by computing the similarity between the query embedding and the document embeddings, and then returning the most similar documents.

```python PYTHON
import numpy as np

# Compute dot product similarity and display results
def return_results(query_emb, doc_emb, documents):
    n = 2 # customize your top N results
    scores = np.dot(query_emb, np.transpose(doc_emb))[0]
    max_idx = np.argsort(-scores)[:n]
        
    for rank, idx in enumerate(max_idx):
        print(f"Rank: {rank+1}")
        print(f"Score: {scores[idx]}")
        print(f"Document: {documents[idx]}\n")
        
return_results(query_emb, doc_emb, documents)
```
