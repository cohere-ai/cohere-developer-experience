The Cohere Toolkit is a collection of pre-built components that allow developers to quickly build and deploy retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications, reducing time-to-launch from months to weeks. It includes front-end and back-end components, and can be deployed on various platforms such as Google Cloud Run, Microsoft Azure, or locally.
