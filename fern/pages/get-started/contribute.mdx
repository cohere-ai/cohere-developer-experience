All our docs content is stored in https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-developer-experience/. 

We welcome contributions to this repo! Feel free to pull request any of the content you see and we will work with you to merge it. The OpenAPI specs and snippets are one-way synced from our internal repositories so we will need to take your changes and merge them behind the scenes.

Please see the repository readme for more guidance.
