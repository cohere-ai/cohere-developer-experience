In this article, you learn how to use [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) to deploy both the Cohere Command models and the Cohere Embed models on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform.

The following models are available through Azure AI Foundry with pay-as-you-go, token-based billing:

- Command R (and the [refreshed Command R model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r#:~:text=Command%20R%20August%202024%20Release))
- Command R+ (and the [refreshed Command R+ model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus#:~:text=Command%20R%2B%20August%202024%20Release))
- Embed v3 - English
- Embed v3 - Multilingual
- Cohere Rerank V3 (English)
- Cohere Rerank V3 (multilingual)

## Prerequisites

Whether you're using Command or Embed, the initial set up is the same. You'll need:

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [Azure AI hub resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource). Note: for Cohere models, the pay-as-you-go deployment offering is only available with AI hubs created in the `EastUS`, `EastUS2` or `Sweden Central` regions.
- An [Azure AI project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects) in Azure AI Studio.
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Studio. To perform the required steps, your user account must be assigned the Azure AI Developer role on the resource group. For more information on permissions, see [Role-based access control in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/rbac-ai-studio).

For workflows based around Command, Embed, or Rerank, you'll also need to create a deployment and consume the model. Here are links for more information:

- **Command:** [create a Command deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command#create-a-new-deployment) and then [consume the Command model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command#create-a-new-deployment).
- **Embed:** [create an Embed deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-embed#create-a-new-deployment) and [consume the Embed model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-embed#consume-the-cohere-embed-models-as-a-service).
- **Rerank**: [create a Rerank deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-rerank) and [consume the Rerank model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-rerank#consume-the-cohere-rerank-models-as-a-service).

Finally, install the Cohere SDK:

```bash
pip install -U cohere
```

## Text Generation

We expose two routes for Command R and Command R+ inference:

- `v1/chat/completions` adheres to the Azure AI Generative Messages API schema; 
- ` v1/chat` supports Cohere's native API schema.

You can find more information about Azure's API [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command#chat-api-reference-for-cohere-models-deployed-as-a-service).

You can find more code snippets, including examples of how to stream responses, in this [notebook](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/foundation-models/cohere/webrequests.ipynb).

Though this section is called "Text Generation", it's worth pointing out that these models are capable of much more. Specifically, you can use Azure-hosted Cohere models for both retrieval augmented generation and [multi-step tool use](/docs/multi-step-tool-use). Check the linked pages for much more information.

Finally, we released refreshed versions of Command R and Command R+ in August 2024, both of which are now available on Azure. Check [these Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-command?tabs=cohere-command-r-08-2024&pivots=programming-language-python#:~:text=the%20model%20catalog.-,Cohere%20Command%20chat%20models,-The%20Cohere%20Command) for more information (select the Cohere Command R 08-2024 or Cohere Command R+ 08-2024 tabs).

## Embeddings

We expose two routes for Embed v3 - English and Embed v3 - Multilingual inference:

- `v1/embeddings` adheres to the Azure AI Generative Messages API schema; 
- ` v1/embed` supports Cohere's native API schema.

You can find more information about Azure's API [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-embed#embed-api-reference-for-cohere-embed-models-deployed-as-a-service).

## ReRank

We currently expose the `v1/rerank` endpoint for inference with both Rerank 3 - English and Rerank 3 - Multilingual. For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-cohere-rerank#rerank-api-reference-for-cohere-rerank-models-deployed-as-a-service) section. 

## Using the Cohere SDK

You can use the Cohere SDK client to consume Cohere models that are deployed via Azure AI Foundry. This means you can leverage the SDK's features such as RAG, tool use, structured outputs, and more.

The following are a few examples on how to use the SDK for the different models.

pip install cohere
