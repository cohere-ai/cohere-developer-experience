This document shows you how to deploy your own finetuned [HuggingFace Command-R model](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-08-2024) using Amazon SageMaker. More specifically, assuming you already have the adapter weights or merged weights from your own finetuned Command model, we will show you how to:

- Merge the adapter weights with the weights of the base model if you only bring the adapter weights;
- Export the merged weights to the TensorRT-LLM inference engine using Amazon SageMaker;
- Deploy the engine as a SageMaker endpoint to serve your business use cases;

You can also find a [companion notebook](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/finetuning/Deploy%20your%20own%20finetuned%20command-r-0824.ipynb) with working code samples. 

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that IAM role used has `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` 
- To deploy your model successfully, ensure that either:
    - Your IAM role has these three permissions, and you have authority to make AWS Marketplace subscriptions in the relevant AWS account:
        - `aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions`
        - `aws-marketplace:Unsubscribe`
        - `aws-marketplace:Subscribe`
    - Or, your AWS account has a subscription to the packages for [Cohere Bring Your Own Fine-tuning](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5wt5pdnw3bbq6). If so, you can skip the "subscribe to the bring your own finetuning algorithm" step below.

**NOTE:** If you're running the companion notebook, know that it contains elements which render correctly in Jupyter interface, so you should open it from an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance or Amazon SageMaker Studio.

## Step 1: Subscribe to the bring your own finetuning algorithm

To subscribe to the algorithm:

- Open the algorithm listing page for [Cohere Bring Your Own Fine-tuning](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5wt5pdnw3bbq6).
- On the AWS Marketplace listing, click on the **Continue to Subscribe** button.
- On the **Subscribe to this software** page, review and click on **Accept Offer** if you and your organization agrees with EULA, pricing, and support terms. On the **Configure and launch** page, make sure the ARN displayed in your region match with the ARN you will use below.

## Step 2: Preliminary setup

First, let's install the Python packages and import them. 

```TEXT 
pip install "cohere>=5.11.0"
```

```Python PYTHON 
import cohere
import os
import sagemaker as sage

from sagemaker.s3 import S3Uploader
```

Make sure you have access to the resources in your AWS account. For example, you can configure an AWS profile by the command `aws configure sso` (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#cli-configure-sso-configure)) and run the command below to set the environment variable `AWS_PROFILE` as your profile name.

```Python PYTHON 
# Change "<aws_profile>" to your own AWS profile name
os.environ["AWS_PROFILE"] = "<aws_profile>"
```

Finally, you need to set all the following variables using your own information. It's best not to add a trailing slash to these paths, as that could mean some parts won't work correctly. You can use either `ml.p4de.24xlarge` or `ml.p5.48xlarge` as the `instance_type` for Cohere Bring Your Own Fine-tuning, but the `instance_type` used for export and inference (endpoint creation) must be identical.

```Python PYTHON 
# The AWS region
region = "<region>"

# Get the arn of the bring your own finetuning algorithm by region
cohere_package = "cohere-command-r-v2-byoft-8370167e649c32a1a5f00267cd334c2c"
algorithm_map = {
    "us-east-1": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-1:865070037744:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "us-east-2": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:us-east-2:057799348421:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "us-west-2": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:594846645681:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "eu-central-1": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:eu-central-1:446921602837:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "ap-southeast-1": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:ap-southeast-1:192199979996:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "ap-southeast-2": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:ap-southeast-2:666831318237:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "ap-northeast-1": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:ap-northeast-1:977537786026:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
    "ap-south-1": f"arn:aws:sagemaker:ap-south-1:077584701553:algorithm/{cohere_package}",
}
if region not in algorithm_map:
    raise Exception(f"Current region {region} is not supported.")
arn = algorithm_map[region]

# The local directory of your adapter weights. No need to specify this, if you bring your own merged weights
adapter_weights_dir = "<adapter_weights_dir>"

# The local directory you want to save the merged weights. Or the local directory of your own merged weights, if you bring your own merged weights
merged_weights_dir = "<merged_weights_dir>"

# The S3 directory you want to save the merged weights
s3_checkpoint_dir = "<s3_checkpoint_dir>"

# The S3 directory you want to save the exported TensorRT-LLM engine. Make sure you do not reuse the same S3 directory across multiple runs
s3_output_dir = "<s3_output_dir>"

# The name of the export
export_name = "<export_name>"

# The name of the SageMaker endpoint
endpoint_name = "<endpoint_name>"

# The instance type for export and inference. Now "ml.p4de.24xlarge" and "ml.p5.48xlarge" are supported
instance_type = "<instance_type>"
```

## Step 3: Get the merged weights

Assuming you use HuggingFace's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) to finetune [Cohere Command](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-08-2024) and get the adapter weights, you can then merge your adapter weights to the base model weights to get the merged weights as shown below. Skip this step if you have already got the merged weights.

```Python PYTHON 
import torch

from peft import PeftModel
from transformers import CohereForCausalLM


def load_and_merge_model(base_model_name_or_path: str, adapter_weights_dir: str):
    """
    Load the base model and the model finetuned by PEFT, and merge the adapter weights to the base weights to get a model with merged weights
    """
    base_model = CohereForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name_or_path)
    peft_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, adapter_weights_dir)
    merged_model = peft_model.merge_and_unload()
    return merged_model


def save_hf_model(output_dir: str, model, tokenizer=None, args=None):
    """
    Save a HuggingFace model (and optionally tokenizer as well as additional args) to a local directory
    """
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    model.save_pretrained(output_dir, state_dict=None, safe_serialization=True)
    if tokenizer is not None:
        tokenizer.save_pretrained(output_dir)
    if args is not None:
        torch.save(args, os.path.join(output_dir, "training_args.bin"))

# Get the merged model from adapter weights
merged_model = load_and_merge_model("CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-08-2024", adapter_weights_dir)

# Save the merged weights to your local directory
save_hf_model(merged_weights_dir, merged_model)
```

## Step 4. Upload the merged weights to S3

```Python PYTHON
sess = sage.Session()
merged_weights = S3Uploader.upload(merged_weights_dir, s3_checkpoint_dir, sagemaker_session=sess)
print("merged_weights", merged_weights)
```

## Step 5. Export the merged weights to the TensorRT-LLM inference engine

Create Cohere client and use it to export the merged weights to the TensorRT-LLM inference engine. The exported TensorRT-LLM engine will be stored in a tar file `{s3_output_dir}/{export_name}.tar.gz` in S3, where the file name is the same as the `export_name`.

```Python PYTHON 
co = cohere.SagemakerClient(aws_region=region)
co.sagemaker_finetuning.export_finetune(
    arn=arn,
    name=export_name,
    s3_checkpoint_dir=s3_checkpoint_dir,
    s3_output_dir=s3_output_dir,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    role="ServiceRoleSagemaker",
)
```

## Step 6. Create an endpoint for inference from the exported engine

The Cohere client provides a built-in method to create an endpoint for inference, which will automatically deploy the model from the TensorRT-LLM engine you just exported.

```Python PYTHON 
co.sagemaker_finetuning.create_endpoint(
    arn=arn,
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    s3_models_dir=s3_output_dir,
    recreate=True,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    role="ServiceRoleSagemaker",
)
```

## Step 7. Perform real-time inference by calling the endpoint

Now, you can perform real-time inference by calling the endpoint you just deployed.

```Python PYTHON
# If the endpoint is already deployed, you can directly connect to it
co.sagemaker_finetuning.connect_to_endpoint(endpoint_name=endpoint_name)

message = "Classify the following text as either very negative, negative, neutral, positive or very positive: mr. deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way."
result = co.sagemaker_finetuning.chat(message=message)
print(result)
```

You can also evaluate your finetuned model using an evaluation dataset. The following is an example with the [ScienceQA](https://scienceqa.github.io/) evaluation using these [data](https://github.com/cohere-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/data/scienceQA_eval.jsonl):

```Python PYTHON
import json
from tqdm import tqdm

eval_data_path = "<path_to_scienceQA_eval.jsonl>"

total = 0
correct = 0
for line in tqdm(open(eval_data_path).readlines()):
    total += 1
    question_answer_json = json.loads(line)
    question = question_answer_json["messages"][0]["content"]
    answer = question_answer_json["messages"][1]["content"]
    model_ans = co.sagemaker_finetuning.chat(message=question, temperature=0).text
    if model_ans == answer:
        correct += 1

print(f"Accuracy of finetuned model is %.3f" % (correct / total))
```

## Step 8. Delete the endpoint (optional)

After you successfully performed the inference, you can delete the deployed endpoint to avoid being charged continuously.

```Python PYTHON
co.sagemaker_finetuning.delete_endpoint()
co.sagemaker_finetuning.close()
```

## Step 9. Unsubscribe to the listing (optional)

If you would like to unsubscribe to the model package, follow these steps. Before you cancel the subscription, ensure that you do not have any [deployable models](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home#/models) created from the model package or using the algorithm. 

**Note:** You can find this information by looking at the container name associated with the model.

Here's how you do that:

- Navigate to **Machine Learning** tab on the [Your Software subscriptions](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/ai/library?productType=ml&ref_=mlmp_gitdemo_indust) page;
- Locate the listing that you want to cancel the subscription for, and then choose **Cancel Subscription** to cancel the subscription.
