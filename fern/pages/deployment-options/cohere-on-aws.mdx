Developers can access a range of Cohere language models in a private environment via Amazon’s AWS Cloud platform. Cohere’s models are supported on two Amazon services: **Amazon SageMaker** and **Amazon Bedrock**.

### Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is a service that allows customers to prepare data and build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. [Read about SageMaker here.](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/)

Cohere offers a comprehensive suite of generative and embedding models through SageMaker on a range of hardware options, many of which support finetuning for deeper customization and performance.

### Amazon Bedrock

**Amazon Bedrock** is a fully managed service where foundational models from Cohere and other LLM providers are made available through a single, serverless API. [Read about Amazon Bedrock here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock).

Cohere has two flagship offerings available on-demand through Amazon Bedrock: Command and the Embed v3 family of models. Finetuning is also supported for the Command and Command-Light models. Cohere will continue to add products and services to Amazon Bedrock in the coming months.
