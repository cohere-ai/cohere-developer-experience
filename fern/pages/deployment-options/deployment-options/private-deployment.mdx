This guide walks through how to pull Cohere's container images using a license and provides testing steps using both Docker and Kubernetes.

(TODO) Links to how to use with cloud providers

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a license and image tag provided by Cohere. In order to get this [contact sales](https://cohere.com/contact-sales). 

## Pull Container Images with License

Cohere will provide access to container images through a registry authenticated with a license. Users can pull these images and replicate them as needed in their environment to avoid runtime network access from inside the cluster. 

Images will come `proxy.replicated.com`. Pulling the images will require firewall access open to `proxy.replicated.com` and `proxy-auth.replicated.com`. More information on these endpoints may be found [here](https://docs.replicated.com/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#firewall-openings-for-online-installations).

To test pulling images with a license, modify your docker CLI configuration to include authentication details for the registry. Note: `docker login` will not work.

The docker CLI is only an example - any tool which can pull images with credentials will work with the license ID configured as both username and password. Skopeo is another popular tool for copying images between registries which will work with this flow.

<Warning title="The following commands will overwrite your existing docker CLI configuration">  
 With authentication details for Cohereâ€™s registry. If preferred, you can manually add the `auths` entry to preserve other configuration.
</Warning>
