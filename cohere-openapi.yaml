    The Cohere Platform is centered around models.

    Each model has a different amount of power (i.e. parameters), to be used for different tasks.

    Cohere also supports finetuning of baseline models to improve performance on downstream tasks or to teach the model large quantities of information which cannot be extracted with few-shot learning or prompt engineering.

                    The name of a compatible [Cohere model](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models) or the ID of a [fine-tuned](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/chat-fine-tuning) model.

                    When `true`, the response will be a JSON stream of events. The final event will contain the complete response, and will have an `event_type` of `"stream-end"`.

                    Streaming is beneficial for user interfaces that render the contents of the response piece by piece, as it gets generated.

                    When specified, the default Cohere preamble will be replaced with the provided one. Preambles are a part of the prompt used to adjust the model's overall behavior and conversation style, and use the `SYSTEM` role.

                    The `SYSTEM` role is also used for the contents of the optional `chat_history=` parameter. When used with the `chat_history=` parameter it adds content throughout a conversation. Conversely, when used with the `preamble=` parameter it adds content at the start of the conversation only.

                    A list of previous messages between the user and the model, giving the model conversational context for responding to the user's `message`.

                    Each item represents a single message in the chat history, excluding the current user turn. It has two properties: `role` and `message`. The `role` identifies the sender (`CHATBOT`, `SYSTEM`, or `USER`), while the `message` contains the text content.

                    The chat_history parameter should not be used for `SYSTEM` messages in most cases. Instead, to add a `SYSTEM` role message at the beginning of a conversation, the `preamble` parameter should be used.

During this process the order of the documents and chat history will be preserved as they are inputted into the API.

                    With `prompt_truncation` set to "OFF", no elements will be dropped. If the sum of the inputs exceeds the model's context length limit, a `TooManyTokens` error will be returned.

                  description: |
                    A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is a string-string dictionary.

                    Example:
                    `[
                      { "title": "Tall penguins", "text": "Emperor penguins are the tallest." },
                      { "title": "Penguin habitats", "text": "Emperor penguins only live in Antarctica." },
                    ]`

                    Keys and values from each document will be serialized to a string and passed to the model. The resulting generation will include citations that reference some of these documents.

                    Some suggested keys are "text", "author", and "date". For better generation quality, it is recommended to keep the total word count of the strings in the dictionary to under 300 words.

                    An `id` field (string) can be optionally supplied to identify the document in the citations. This field will not be passed to the model.

                    An `_excludes` field (array of strings) can be optionally supplied to omit some key-value pairs from being shown to the model. The omitted fields will still show up in the citation object. The "_excludes" field will not be passed to the model.

                    See ['Document Mode'](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#document-mode) in the guide for more information.

                    The final event will contain the complete response, and will contain an `is_finished` field set to `true`. The event will also contain a `finish_reason`, which can be one of the following:
                    - `COMPLETE` - the model sent back a finished reply
                    - `MAX_TOKENS` - the reply was cut off because the model reached the maximum number of tokens for its context length
                    - `ERROR` - something went wrong when generating the reply

        This endpoint returns text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.

        Embeddings can be used to create text classifiers as well as empower semantic search. To learn more about embeddings, see the embedding page.

        If you want to learn more how to use the embedding model, have a look at the [Semantic Search Guide](/docs/semantic-search).

                    Passing `START` will discard the start of the input. `END` will discard the end of the input. In both cases, input is discarded until the remaining input is exactly the maximum input token length for the model.

                    A list of up to 96 texts to be classified. Each one must be a non-empty string.
                    There is, however, no consistent, universal limit to the length a particular input can be. We perform classification on the first `x` tokens of each input, and `x` varies depending on which underlying model is powering classification. The maximum token length for each model is listed in the "max tokens" column [here](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).
                    Note: by default the `truncate` parameter is set to `END`, so tokens exceeding the limit will be automatically dropped. This behavior can be disabled by setting `truncate` to `NONE`, which will result in validation errors for longer texts.

              Example:
                value:
                  text: "Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
                    dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured
                    with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a
                    spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as
                    strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a
                    flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food
                    coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The
                    mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and
                    stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable
                    ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth,
                    semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures
                    (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its
                    temperature increases.


                    The meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one
                    country to another. In some countries, such as the United
                    States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety,
                    and most governments regulate the commercial use of the
                    various terms according to the relative quantities of the
                    main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that
                    do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are
                    sometimes labelled \"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In
                    other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is
                    used fo\r all variants. Analogues made from dairy
                    alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk
                    substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk or
                    tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant,
                    allergic to dairy protein or vegan."

        Configuration for forcing the model output to adhere to the specified format. Supported on [Command R](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r), [Command R+](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/command-r-plus) and newer models.

        The model can be forced into outputting JSON objects (with up to 5 levels of nesting) by setting `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

        A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) can optionally be provided, to ensure a specific structure.

        **Note**: When using  `{ "type": "json_object" }` your `message` should always explicitly instruct the model to generate a JSON (eg: _"Generate a JSON ..."_) . Otherwise the model may end up getting stuck generating an infinite stream of characters and eventually run out of context length.
        **Limitation**: The parameter is not supported in RAG mode (when any of `connectors`, `documents`, `tools`, `tool_results` are provided).
